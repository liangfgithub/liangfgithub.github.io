A graphical diagnostic written in S-plus is introduced that allows the user to determine both the general quality of the fit of a variogram model, and to find specific pairs of locations that do not have measurements that are consonant with the fitted variogram. It can help identify nonstationarity, outliers, and poor variogram fit in general. Simulated data sets and a set of soil nitrogen concentration data are examined using this graphical diagnostic.","In this paper a highly interactive, user-friendly Lisp program is introduced to perform homogeneity analysis. A brief introduction to the technique is presented as well as its modification in the presence of missing data. The algorithm and its Lisp implemenation is discussed, and an overview of the object oriented code that produces the interactive dialogs and plots is provided. In order to demonstrate the main features of the program, a small and a large dataset are analyzed. Finally, some comparisons are made with other currently available programs.","This paper describes a set of Lisp-Stat tools for building Generalised Estimating Equation models to analyse longitudinal or clustered measurements. The user interface is based on the built-in regression and generalised linear model prototypes, with the addition of object-based error functions, correlation structures and model formula tools. Residual and deletion diagnostic plots are available on the cluster and observation level and use the dynamic graphics capabilities of Lisp-Stat.","This paper describes the incorporation of seven stand-alone clustering programs into S-PLUS, where they can now be used in a much more flexible way. The original Fortran programs carried out new cluster analysis algorithms introduced in the book of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990). These clustering methods were designed to be robust and to accept dissimilarity data as well as objects-by-variables data. Moreover, they each provide a graphical display and a quality index reflecting the strength of the clustering. The powerful graphics of S-PLUS made it possible to improve these graphical representations considerably.  The integration of the clustering algorithms was performed according to the object-oriented principle supported by S-PLUS. The new functions have a uniform interface, and are compatible with existing S-PLUS functions. We will describe the basic idea and the use of each clustering method, together with its graphical features. Each function is briefly illustrated with an example.","On the UCLA Statistics WWW server there are a large number of demos and calculators that can be used in statistics teaching and research. Some of these demos require substantial amounts of computation, others mainly use graphics. These calculators and demos are implemented in various different ways, reflecting developments in WWW based computing. \n\nAs usual, one of the main choices is between doing the work on the client-side (i.e. in the browser) or on the server-side (i.e. on our WWW server). Obviously, client-side computation puts fewer demands on the server. On the other hand, it requires that the client downloads Java applets, or installs plugins and/or helpers. If JavaScript is used, client-side computations will generally be slow. We also have to assume that the client is installed properly, and has the required capabilities. Requiring too much on the client-side has caused browsing machines such as Netscape Communicator to grow beyond all reasonable bounds, both in size and RAM requirements. Moreover requiring Java and JavaScript rules out such excellent browsers as Lynx or Emacs W3. \n\nFor server-side computing, we can configure the server and its resources ourselves, and we need not worry about browser capabilities and configuration.  Nothing needs to be downloaded, except the usual HTML pages and graphics. In the same way as on the client side, there is a scripting solution, where code is interpreted, or a ob ject-code solution using compiled code. For the server-side scripting, we use embedded languages, such as PHP/FI. The scripts in the HTML pages are interpreted by a CGI program, and the output of the CGI program is send to the clients. Of course the CGI program is compiled, but the statistics procedures will usually be interpreted, because PHP/FI does not have the appropriate functions in its scripting language. This will tend to be slow, because embedded languages do not deal efficiently with loops and similar \nconstructs. \n\nThus a first step towards greater efficiency is to compile the necessary primitives into the PHP/FI executable. This is easy to do, because the API is quite simple. In the extensions below, we have added the complete ranlib and dcdflib to PHP, plus some additional useful functions. The source code for these extensions, plus Solaris binaries for libranlib.a and libdcdf.a can be obtained from our server. \n\nInterpreting a PHP script, even with our new primitives, still requires starting up a CGI process for each page that is read. Again, this can be improved upon. We could use FastCGI to keep the CGI process around on a permanent basis. Instead, we have chosen a more direct method. PHP can be compiled as an Apache module, i.e. it can be compiled into the Apache HTTPD server binary. This means that PHP scripts are interpreted by the WWW server, which is always around, and which will fork additional children if necessary. No CGI processes need to be started. The PHP install process creates a libphp.a and mod_php.c in the Apache source directories, which can be used to build an enhanced server. This has the additional advantage of security, because all security features of the server can be used, and none of the pitfalls of using CGI or Java apply. \n\nUsing PHP, in combination with the WWW server, also has some disadvantages. Although we can make simple static plots, using the gd library, we cannot use any dynamics, and interaction between the user and the page is somewhat limited. Java, or scripts using a client-side Xlisp-Stat as a helper, are more flexible in this respect. As a consequence, the UCLA Statistics pages still use a combined approach, with server-side PHP and CGI and client-side Xlisp-Stat and Java/JavaScript. Sometime this year, server-side Java scripting will become available, and then it seems advisable to switch as much of the code as possible to the server-side.","The asypow library consists of routines written in the S language that calculate power and related quantities utilizing asymptotic methods. A paper describing these methods with examples is in preparation [1]. Two methods are available. The likelihood ratio method (LR) is described in [2]. Another general method appears recently in [3]; and we designate it the SMO method after the initials of the authors.","The Java programming language has added a new tool for delivering computing applications over the World Wide Web (WWW). WebStat is a new computing environment for basic statistical analysis which is delivered in the form of a Java applet. Anyone with WWW access and a Java capable browser can access this new analysis environment. Along with an overall introduction of the environment, the main features of this package are illustrated, and the prospect of using basic WebStat components for more advanced applications is discussed.","A computer program for multifactor relative risks, confidence limits, and tests of hypotheses using regression coefficients and a variance-covariance matrix obtained from a previous additive or multiplicative regression analysis is described in detail. Data used by the program can be stored and input from an external disk-file or entered via the keyboard. The output contains a list of the input data, point estimates of single or joint effects, confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses based on a minimum modified chi-square statistic. Availability of the program is also discussed.","A computer program to estimate Poisson regression coefficients, standard errors, Pearson x2 and deviance goodness of fit (and residuals), leverages, and Freeman-Tukey, standardized, and deletion residuals for additive, multiplicative, power, and non-linear models is described. Data used by the program must be stored and input from a disk file. The output file contains an optional list of the input data, observed and fitted count data (deaths or cases), coefficients, standard errors, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals, variance-covariance matrix, correlation matrix, goodness of fit statistics, and residuals for regression diagnostics.","We consider the fitting of a mixture of two Gompertz distributions to censored survival data.  This model is therefore applicable where there are two distinct causes for failure that act in a mutually exclusive manner, and the baseline failure time for each cause follows a Gompertz distribution.  For example, in a study of a disease such as breast cancer, suppose that failure corresponds to death, whose cause is attributed either to breast cancer or some other cause.  In this example, the mixing proportion for the component of the mixture representing time to death from a cause other than breast cancer may be interpreted to be the cure rate for breast cancer (Gordon, 1990a and 1990b).  This Gompertz mixture model whose components are adjusted multiplicatively to reflect the age of the patient at the origin of the survival time, is fitted by maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977).  There is the provision to handle the case where the mixing proportions are formulated in terms of a logistic model to depend on a vector of covariates associated with each survival time.  The algorithm can also handle the case where there is only one cause of failure, but which may happen at infinity for some patients with a nonzero probability (Farewell, 1982).","A highly interactive, user-friendly object-oriented software package written in LispStat is introduced that performs simple and multiple correspondence analysis, and profile analysis. These three techniques are integrated into a single environment driven by a user-friendly graphical interface that takes advantage of Lisp-Stat's advanced graphical capabilities. Techniques that assess the stability of the solution are also introduced. Some of the features of the package include colored graphics, incremental graph zooming capabilities, manual point separation to determine identities of overlapping points, and stability and fit measures. The features of the package are used to show some interesting trends in a large educational dataset.","MCSim consists of two pieces, a model generator and a simulation engine.  The model generator, mod, was created to facilitate the model maintenance and simulation definition, while keeping execution time fast.  Other programs have been created to the same end, the Matlab family of graphical interactive programs being some of the more general and easy to use.  Still, many available tools are not optimal for performing time and computer intensive Monte Carlo analysis.  MCSim was created specifically to this end: to perform Monte Carlo analysis in a highly optimized, and easy to maintain environment.","This paper provides a suite of datasets from standard multivariate distributions and simple high-dimensional geomtric shapes that can be used to visually calibrate new users of grand tours. It contains animations of 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, 4-D and 5-D grand tours, links to starting XGobi or XLispStat on the calibration data sets, and C code for generating a grand tour. \n\nThe purpose of the paper is two-fold: providing code for the grand tour that others could pick up and modify (it is not easy to code this version which is why there are very few implementations currently available), and secondly, provide a variety of training datasets to help new users get a visual sense for high-dimensional data.","The incomplete beta function is defined as where Beta(p, q) is the beta function. Dutka (1981) gave a history of the development and numerical evaluation of this function. In this article, an algorithm for computing first and second derivatives of Ix,p,q with respect to p and q is described. The algorithm is useful, for example, when fitting parameters to a censored beta, truncated beta, or a truncated beta-binomial model.","This document contains program code and examples of survival analyses in XLISP-Stat, structured using the noweb (Ramsey, 1993) literate programming system. It is described as a \"semiliterate\" program because most of the code was already written before it was converted to use noweb.","Rweb is a freely accessible statistical analysis environment that is delivered through the World Wide Web (WWW). It is based on R, a well known statistical analysis package. The only requirement to run the basic Rweb interface is a WWW browser that supports forms. If you want graphical output you must, of course, have a browser that supports graphics. The interface provides access to WWW accessible data sets, so you may run Rweb on your own data. Rweb can provide a four window statistical computing environment (code input, text output, graphical output, and error information) through browsers that support Javascript. There is also a set of point and click modules under development for use in introductory statistics courses.","Robust regression procedures have considerable attention in mathematical statistics literature. They, however, have not received nearly as much attention by practitioners performing data analysis. A contributing factor to this may be the lack of availability of these procedures in commonly used statistical software. In this paper we propose algorithms for obtaining parameter estimates and their asymptotic standard errors when fitting regression models to data assuming normal/independent errors. The algorithms proposed can be implemented in the commonly available nonlinear regression programs. We review a nubmer of previously proposed algorithms. As we discuss, these require special code and are difficult to implement in a nonlinear regression program. Methods of implementing the proposed algorithms in SAS-NLIN is discussed. Specifically, the two applications of regeression with the t and the slash family errors are discussed in detail. SAS NLIN and S-plus instructions are given for these two examples. Minor modification of these instructions can solve other problems at hand.","We consider the fitting of normal or t-component mixture models to multivariate data, using maximum likelikhood via the EM algorithm. This approach requires the initial specification of an initial estimate of the vector of unknown parameters, or equivalently of an initial classification of the data with respect to the components of the mixture model under fit. We describe an algorithm called EMMIX that automatically undertakes this fitting: including the provision of suitable initial values if not supplied by the user. The EMMIX algorithm has several options, including the option to carry out a resampling-based test for the number of components in the mixture model.","We consider the problem of estimating an unknown distribution function in the presence of censoring under the conditions that a parametric model is believed to hold approximately. We use a Bayesian approach, in which the prior on is a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. A hyperparameter of the prior determines the extent to which this prior concentrates its mass around the parametric family. A Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters of interest is reviewed. An importance sampling scheme enables us to use the output of the Gibbs sampler to very quickly recalculate the posterior when we change the hyperparameters of the prior. The calculations can be done sufficiently fast to enable the dynamic display of the changing posterior as the prior hyperparameters are varied. \n\nThis paper provides a literate program completely documenting the code for performing the dynamic graphics.","Generalized linear models unite a wide variety of statistical models in a common theoretical framework. This paper discusses GLMLAB-software that enables such models to be fitted in the popular mathematical package MATLAB. It provides a graphical user interface to the powerful MATLAB computational engine to produce a program that is easy to use but with many features, including offsets, prior weights and user-defined distributions and link functions. MATLAB's graphical capacities are also utilized in providing a number of simple residual diagnostic plots.","MIXNO provides maximum marginal likelihood estimates for mixed-effects nominal logistic regression analysis.  These models can be used for analysis of correlated nominal response data, for example, data arising from a clustered or longitudinal design.  For such data, the mixed-effects model assumes that data within clusters or sub jects are dependent.  The degree of dependency is jointly estimated with the usual model parameters, thus adjusting for dependence resulting from nesting of the data. MIXNO uses marginal maximum likelihood estimation, utilizing a Fisher-scoring solution.  For the scoring solution, the Cholesky factor of the random-effects variance-covariance matrix is estimated along with the (fixed) effects of explanatory variables. Examples illustrating usage and features of MIXNO are provided.","This paper discusses an algorithm for computing the cumulative distribution function cdf for the generalized F distribution and the companion Fortran77 code GENF. Examples of such distributions are the Cook's DI statistics and the Hotelling's T test when the covariance is misspecified.","Bayes linear methodology provides a quantitative structure for expressing our beliefs and systematic methods for revising these beliefs given observational data. Particular emphasis is placed upon interpretation of and diagnostics for the specification. The approach is similar in spirit to the standard Bayes analysis, but is constructed so as to avoid much of the burden of specification and computation of the full Bayes case. This report is the first of a series describing Bayes linear methods. In this document, we introduce some of the basic machinery of the theory. Examples, computational issues, detailed derivations of results and approaches to belief elicitation will be addressed in related reports.","Statistical computing when input/output is driven by a Graphical User Interface is considered. A proposal is made for automatic control of computational flow to ensure that only strictly required computations are actually carried on. The computational flow is modeled by a directed graph for implementation in any object-oriented programming language with symbolic manipulation capabilities. A complete implementation example is presented to compute and display frequency based piecewise linear density estimators such as histograms or frequency polygons.","The most common summary of a fitted statistical model, a list of parameter estimates and standard errors, does not give the precision of estimated combinations of the parameters, such as differences or ratios. For this, covariances also are needed; but space constraints typically mean that the full covariance matrix cannot routinely be reported. In the important case of parameters associated with the discrete levels of an experimental factor or with a categorical classifying variable, the identifiable parameter combinations are linear contrasts. The QV Calculator computes \"quasi-variances\" which may be used as an alternative summary of the precision of the estimated parameters. The summary based on quasi-variances is simple and permits good approximation of the standard error of any desired contrast. The idea of such a summary has been suggested by Ridout (1989) and, under the name \"floating absolute risk\", by Easton, Peto & Babiker (1991). It applies to a wide variety of statistical models, including linear and nonlinear regressions, generalized-linear and GEE models, Cox proportional-hazard models for survival data, generalized additive models, etc. \n\nThe QV Calculator is written in Xlisp-Stat (Tierney, 1990) and can be used either directly by users who have access to Xlisp-Stat or through a web interface by those who do not. The user either supplies the covariance matrix for the effect parameters of interest, or, if using Xlisp-Stat directly, can generate that matrix by interaction with a model object.","Confidence intervals for multinomial proportions are often constructed using large-sample methods that rely on expected cell counts of 5 or greater.  In situations that give rise to a large number of categories, the cell counts may not be of adequate size to ensure the appropriate overall coverage probability and alternative methods of construction have been proposed.  Sison and Glaz (1995) developed a method of constructing two-sided confidence intervals for multinomial proportions that is based on the doubly truncated Poisson distribution and their method performs well when the cell counts are fairly equally dispersed over a large number of categories.  In fact, the Sison and Glaz (1995) intervals appear to outperform other methods of simultaneous construction in terms of coverage probabilities and interval length in these situations.  To make the method available to researchers, we have developed a SAS macro to construct the intervals proposed by Sison and Glaz (1995).","See paper for mathematical introduction.","We present a non exhaustive bibliographical and comparative study of the problem of simulation and identification of the fractional Brownian motion. The discussed implementation is realized within the software S-plus 3.4. A few simulations illustrate this work. Furthermore, we propose a test based on the asymptotic behavior of a self-similarity parameter's estimator to explore the quality of different generators. This procedure, easily computable, allows us to extract an efficient method of simulation. In the Appendix are described the S-plus scripts related to simulation and identification methods of the fBm.","We provide a new version of our ziggurat method for generating a random variable from a given decreasing density. It is faster and simpler than the original, and will produce, for example, normal or exponential variates at the rate of 15 million per second with a C version on a 400MHz PC. It uses two tables, integers ki, and reals wi. Some 99% of the time, the required x is produced by: Generate a random 32-bit integer j and let i be the index formed from the rightmost 8 bits of j. If j < k, return x = j x wi.\n  \nWe illustrate with C code that provides for inline generation of both normal and exponential variables, with a short procedure for settting up the necessary tables.","The World Wide Web (WWW) is a new mechanism for providing information. At this point, the majority of the information on the WWW is static, which means it is incapable of responding to user input. Text, images, and video are examples of static information that can easily be included in a WWW page. With the advent of the Java programming language, it is now possible to embed dynamic information in the form of interactive programs called applets. Therefore, it is not only possible to transfer raw data over the WWW, but we can also now provide interactive graphics for displaying and exploring data in the context of a WWW page. In this paper, we will describe the use of Java applets that have been developed for the interactive display of high dimensional data on the WWW.","CoCo is a program for estimation, test and model search among hierarchical interaction models for large complete contingency tables. The name CoCo is derivated of \"Co\"mplete \"Co\"ntingency tables, since the initial program could only handle complete tables, but the program has been enhanced to handle incomplete tables.\n\nCoCo works especially efficiently on graphical models, and some of the commands are designed to handle graphical models.","SUBSET, written in the matrix language Gauss, is a program that identifies optimal subsets of means or proportions based on independent groups. All possible configurations of ordered subsets of groups are identified and the best model is selected using either the AIC or BIC information criterion. For means, both homogeneous and heterogeneous variance cases are considered. SUBSET offers an alternative approach to traditional post-hoc multiple-comparison procedures such as the Tukey test for pairwise comparisons. Major advantages of SUBSET over traditional pairwise comparison procedures include the fact that intransitive decisions are avoided and that issues related to type I error control, sample size and heterogeneity of variance do not arise.","MARCH is a free software for the computation of different types of Markovian models including homogeneous Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Double Chain Markov Models (DCMMs). The main characteristic of this software is the implementation of a powerful optimization method for HMMs and DCMMs combining a genetic algorithm with the standard Baum-Welch procedure. MARCH is distributed as a set of Matlab functions running under Matlab 5 or higher on any computing platform. A PC Windows version running independently from Matlab is also available.","See paper for mathematical introduction.","In this paper we describe the Xlisp-Stat version of the sm library, a software for applying nonparametric kernel smoothing methods. The original version of the sm library was written by Bowman and Azzalini in S-Plus, and it is documented in their book Applied Smoothing Techniques for Data Analysis (1997). This is also the main reference for a complete description of the statistical methods implemented. \n\n  The sm library provides kernel smoothing methods for obtaining nonparametric estimates of density functions and regression curves for different data structures. Smoothing techniques may be employed as a descriptive graphical tool for exploratory data analysis. Furthermore, they can also serve for inferential purposes as, for instance, when a nonparametric estimate is used for checking a proposed parametric model. The Xlisp-Stat version includes some extensions to the original sm library, mainly in the area of local likelihood estimation for generalized linear models. \n\nThe Xlisp-Stat version of the sm library has been written following an object-oriented approach. This should allow experienced Xlisp-Stat users to implement easily their own methods and new research ideas into the built-in prototypes.","Wavelet analysis has been found to be a powerful tool for the nonparametric estimation of spatially-variable objects. We discuss in detail wavelet methods in nonparametric regression, where the data are modelled as observations of a signal contaminated with additive Gaussian noise, and provide an extensive review of the vast literature of wavelet shrinkage and wavelet thresholding estimators developed to denoise such data. These estimators arise from a wide range of classical and empirical Bayes methods treating either individual or blocks of wavelet coefficients. We compare various estimators in an extensive simulation study on a variety of sample sizes, test functions, signal-to-noise ratios and wavelet filters. Because there is no single criterion that can adequately summarise the behaviour of an estimator, we use various criteria to measure performance in finite sample situations. Insight into the performance of these estimators is obtained from graphical outputs and numerical tables. In order to provide some hints of how these estimators should be used to analyse real data sets, a detailed practical step-by-step illustration of a wavelet denoising analysis on electrical consumption is provided. Matlab codes are provided so that all figures and tables in this paper can be reproduced.","An algorithm for the computation of multivariate normal and multivariate t probabilities over general hyperellipsoidal regions is given. A special case is the calculation of probabilities for central and noncentral F and x2 distributions. A FORTRAN 90 program MVELPS.FOR incorporates the algorithm.","This paper reviews tests for structural change in linear regression models from the generalized fluctuation test framework as well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. It introduces a unified approach for implementing these tests and presents how these ideas have been realized in an R package called strucchange. Enhancing the standard significance test approach the package contains methods to fit, plot and test empirical fluctuation processes (like CUSUM, MOSUM and estimates-based processes) and to compute, plot and test sequences of F statistics with the supF , aveF and expF test. Thus, it makes powerful tools available to display information about structural changes in regression relationships and to assess their significance. Furthermore, it is described how incoming data can be monitored.","We describe three tests of randomness-- tests that many random number generators fail. In particular, all congruential generators-- even those based on a prime modulus-- fail at least one of the tests, as do many simple generators, such as shift register and lagged Fibonacci. On the other hand, generators that pass the three tests seem to pass all the tests in the Diehard Battery of Tests. \n\nNote that these tests concern the randomness of a generator's output as a sequence of independent, uniform 32-bit integers. For uses where the output is converted to uniform variates in [0,1), potential flaws of the output as integers will seldom cause problems after the conversion. Most generators seem to be adequate for producing a set of uniform reals in [0,1), but several important applications, notably in cryptography and number theory-- for example, establishing probable primes, complexity of factoring algorithms, random partitions of large integers-- may require satisfactory performance on the kinds of tests we describe here.","Hydra is an open-source, platform-neutral library for performing Markov Chain Monte Carlo. It implements the logic of standard MCMC samplers within a framework designed to be easy to use, extend, and integrate with other software tools. In this paper, we describe the problem that motivated our work, outline our goals for the Hydra pro ject, and describe the current features of the Hydra library. We then provide a step-by-step example of using Hydra to simulate from a mixture model drawn from cancer genetics, first using a variable-at-a-time Metropolis sampler and then a Normal Kernel Coupler. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for Hydra.","The purpose of this paper is to describe a simple program for computing log-linear analysis based on a direct manipulation interface that emphasizes the use of plots for guiding the analysis and evaluating the results obtained.

(2000, 2002) using the BUGS software (Spiegelhalter et al. , 1996a,b,c). The specification of the likelihood, prior and pseudo-prior distributions of the parameters as well as the prior term and model probabilities are described in detail. Guidance is also provided for the calculation of the posterior probabilities within BUGS environment when the number of models is limited. We illustrate the application of this methodology in a variety of problems including linear regression, log-linear and binomial response models.","In this paper, a SAS program (macro) is written to generate factor and regression variables required for implementing asymmetry, non-independence, non-symmetry + independence models as well as skew-symmetry models in discussed in square a x a contingency tables having nominal or ordinal categories. While several authors have developed similar factor variables for use with GLIM, we have extended this to the non-independence and the non-symmetry+independence models. The former includes both the fixed and variable distance models as well as the quasi-ordinal symmetry model. Further, our implementation of the asymmetry model in terms of the required factor variable is different from those defined for implementation of same in GLIM. Most of the models described in this paper however assume ordinal categories for the contingency table. The SAS macro developed can be applied to any square table of dimension a.\n\nWe apply the models discussed in this paper to the 5 x 5 Danish mobility data that have been widely analyzed in various literatures.","Recurrence plots are graphical devices specially suited to detect hidden dynamical patterns and nonlinearities in data. However, there are few programs available to apply such a mehodology. This paper reviews one of the best free programs to apply nonlinear time series analysis: Visual Recurrence Analysis (VRA). This program is targeted to recurrence analysis and the so-called Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA, the quantitative counterpart of recurrence plots), although it includes many procedures in a friendly visual environment. Comparisons with alternative programs are performed.","Different methods of data analysis (e.g. clustering and ordination) are based on distance matrices.  In some cases, researchers may wish to compare several distance matrices with one another in order to test a hypothesis concerning a possible relationship between these matrices. However, this is not always self-evident. Usually, values in distance matrices are, in some way, correlated and therefore the usual assumption of independence between objects is violated in the classical tests approach. Furthermore, often, spurious correlations can be observed when comparing two distances matrices. A classic example is the comparison between genetic and environmental distances. Colonies that are in close proximity of each other tend to have similar environments and therefore there will be a positive correlation between environmental and geographical distances.  Such colonies will also be more likely to exchange migrants so that genetic distances will be positively correlated with spatial distances. The consequence is that an observed positive association between genetic and environmental distances may be simply due to spatial effects.  The most widely used method to account for distance correlations is a procedure known as the Mantel test (Mantel, 1967; Mantel and Valand, 1970 following the pioneering work of Daniels, 1944 ; Daniels and Kendall 1947). The simple Mantel test considers two matrices while an extension known as the partial Mantel test considers three matrices. These tools are widely used in different fields of research such as population genetics, ecology, anthropology, psychometrics and sociology.","This paper introduces a SAS/IML program to select among the multivariate model candidates based on a few well-known multivariate model selection criteria. Stepwise regression and all-possible-regression are considered. The program is user friendly and requires the user to paste or read the data at the beginning of the module, include the names of the dependent and independent variables (the y's and the x's), and then run the module. The program produces the multivariate candidate models based on the following criteria: Forward Selection, Forward Stepwise Regression, Backward Elimination, Mean Square Error, Coefficient of Multiple Determination, Adjusted Coefficient of Multiple Determination, Akaike's Information Criterion, the Corrected Form of Akaike's Information Criterion, Hannan and Quinn Information Criterion, the Corrected Form of Hannan and Quinn (HQc) Information Criterion, Schwarz's Criterion, and Mallow's PC. The output also constitutes detailed as well as summarized results.","This paper presents the Mondrian data visualization software. In addition to standard plots like histograms, barcharts, scatterplots or maps, Mondrian offers advanced plots for high dimensional categorical (mosaic plots) and continuous data (parallel coordinates).  All plots are linked and offer various interaction techniques.  A special focus is on the seamless integration of categorical data.  Unique is Mondrian's special selection technique, which allows advanced selections in complex data sets.  Besides loading data from local (ASCII) files it can connect to databases, avoiding a local copy of the data on the client machine.\n\nMondrian is written in 100% pure JAVA.","A Web-based statistical tool for sample size and power estimation in animal carcinogenicity studies is presented in this paper. It can be used to provide a design with sufficient power for detecting a dose-related trend in the occurrence of a tumor of interest when competing risks are present. The tumors of interest typically are occult tumors for which the time to tumor onset is not directly observable. It is applicable to rodent tumorigenicity assays that have either a single terminal sacrifice or multiple (interval) sacrifices. The design is achieved by varying sample size per group, number of sacrifices, number of sacrificed animals at each interval, if any, and scheduled time points for sacrifice. Monte Carlo simulation is carried out in this tool to simulate experiments of rodent bioassays because no closed-form solution is available. It takes design parameters for sample size and power estimation as inputs through the World Wide Web. The core program is written in C and executed in the background. It communicates with the Web front end via a Component Object Model interface passing an Extensible Markup Language string. The proposed statistical tool is illustrated with an animal study in lung cancer prevention research.","Clarify is a program that uses Monte Carlo simulation to convert the raw output of statistical procedures into results that are of direct interest to researchers, without changing statistical assumptions or requiring new statistical models. The program, designed for use with the Stata statistics package, offers a convenient way to implement the techniques described in: Gary King, Michael Tomz, and Jason Wittenberg (2000). \"Making the Most of Statistical Analyses: Improving Interpretation and Presentation.\" American Journal of Political Science 44, no. 2 (April 2000): 347-61.\n\nWe recommend that you read this article before using the software.\n\nClarify simulates quantities of interest for the most commonly used statistical models, including linear regression, binary logit, binary probit, ordered logit, ordered probit, multinomial logit, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, weibull regression, seemingly unrelated regression equations, and the additive logistic normal model for compositional data. Clarify Version 2.1 is forthcoming (2003) in Journal of Statistical Software.","Density distribution sunflower plots are used to display high-density bivariate data.  They are useful for data where a conventional scatter plot is difficult to read due to overstriking of the plot symbol.  The x-y plane is subdivided into a lattice of regular hexagonal bins of width w specified by the user.  The user also specifies the values of l, d, and k that affect the plot as follows.  Individual observations are plotted when there are less than l observations per bin as in a conventional scatter plot.  Each bin with from l to d observations contains a light sunflower.  Other bins contain a dark sunflower. In a light sunflower each petal represents one observation.  In a dark sunflower, each petal represents k observations.  (A dark sunflower with p petals represents between /2-pk k  and /2+pk k  observations.)  The user can control the sizes and colors of the sunflowers.  By selecting appropriate colors and sizes for the light and dark sunflowers, plots can be obtained that give both the overall sense of the data density distribution as well as the number of data points in any given region.  The use of this graphic is illustrated with data from the Framingham Heart Study.  A documented Stata program, called sunflower, is available to draw these graphs.  It can be downloaded from the Statistical Software Components archive at http://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s430201.html .  (Journal of Statistical Software 2003; 8 (3): 1-5.  Posted at http://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php?vol=8 .)","We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros (\"nonevents\"). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can shar ply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects repor ted in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of obser vations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanator y variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanator y variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.","In this paper, I present computational procedures to obtian statistical tables. The tables of the asymptotic distribution and the exact distribution of Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic Dn for one population, the table of the distribution of the runs R, the table of the distribution of Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic W+ and the table of the distribution of Mann-Whitney statistic Ux using Mathematica, Version 3.9 under Window98. I think that it is an interesting cuestion because many statistical packages give the asymptotic significance level in the statistical tests and with these porcedures one can easily calculate the exact significance levels and the left-tail and right-tail probabilities with non-parametric distributions.\n\nI have used mathematica to make these calculations because one can use symbolic language to solve recursion relations. It's very easy to generate the format of the tables, and it's possible to obtain any table of the mentioned non-parametric distributions with any precision, not only with the standard parameters more used in Statistics, and without transcription mistakes.\n \nFurthermore, using similar procedures, we can generate tables for the following distribution functions: Binomial, Poisson, Hypergeometric, Normal, x2 Chi-Square, T-Student, F-Snedecor, Geometric, Gamma and Beta.","The large number of parameters in subset vector autoregressive models often leads one to procure fast, simple, and efficient alternatives or precursors to maximum likelihood estimation. We present the solution of the multivariate subset Yule-Walker equations as one such alternative. In recent work, Brockwell, Dahlhaus, and Trindade (2002), show that the Yule-Walker estimators can actually be obtained as a special case of a general recursive Burg-type algorithm. We illustrate the structure of this Algorithm, and discuss its implementation in a high-level programming language. Applications of the Algorithm in univariate and bivariate modeling are showcased in examples. Univariate and bivariate versions of the Algorithm written in Fortran 90 are included in the appendix, and their use illustrated.","SparseM provides some basic R functionality for linear algebra with sparse matrices. Use of the package is illustrated by a family of linear model fitting functions that implement least squares methods for problems with sparse design matrices. Significant performance improvements in memory utilization and computational speed are possible for applications involving large sparse matrices.","Data swapping is a statistical disclosure limitation practice that alters records in the data to be released by switching values of attributes across pairs of records in a fraction of the original data.\n \nWeb Services are an exciting new form of distributed computing that allow users to invoke remote applications nearly transparently. National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) has recently started hosting NISS Web Services as a service and example to the statistical sciences community. In this paper we describe and provide usage information for NISS WebSwap the initial NISS Web Service, which swaps one or more attributes (fields) between user-specified records in a microdata file, uploading the original data file from the user's computer and downloading the file containing the swapped records.","MinPROMEP, written in SAS macros, is a program that generates partially replicated minimal orthogonal main-effect plans (minimal PROMEP's) for a given set of specified factor levels. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalization of the construction of Jacroux (1992, 1993). By using specific collapsing schemes, duplicated points are embedded in the design. In some cases, the generated minimal PROMEP has maximum number of duplicate points.","We introduce General Multilevel Models and discuss the estimation procedures that may be used to fit multilevel models. We apply the proposed procedures to three-level binary data generated in a simulation study. We compare the procedures by two criteria, Bias and efficiency. We find that the estimates of the fixed effects and variance components are substantially and significantly biased using Longford's Approximation and Goldstein's Generalized Least Squares approaches by two software packages VARCL and ML3. These estimates are not significantly biased and are very close to real values when we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) using Gibbs sampling or Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood (NPML) approach. The Gaussian Quadrature (GQ) approach, even with small number of mass points results in consistent estimates but computationally problematic. We conclude that the MCMC and the NPML approaches are the recommended procedures to fit multilevel models.","CGIwithR is a package for use with the R statistical computing environment, to facilitate processing of information from web-based forms, and reporting of results in the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), through the Common Gateway Interface (CGI). CGIwithR permits the straightforward use of R as a CGI scripting language. This paper serves as an extended user manual for CGIwithR, supplementary to the R help pages installed with the package.","Scatterplot3d is an R package for the visualization of multivariate data in a three dimensional space. R is a \"language for data analysis and graphics\". \n\nIn this paper we discuss the features of the package. It is designed by exclusively making use of already existing functions of R and its graphics system and thus shows the extensibility of the R graphics system. Additionally some examples on generated and real world data are provided.","Description of a class of simple, extremely fast random number generators (RNGs) with periods 2k - 1 for k = 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192. These RNGs seem to pass tests of randomness very well.","This paper reviews current quadrature methods for approximate calculation of integrals within S-Plus or R. Starting with the general framework, Gaussian quadrature will be discussed first, followed by adaptive rules and Monte Carlo methods. Finally, a comparison of the methods presented is given. The aim of this survey paper is to help readers, not expert in computing, to apply numerical integration methods and to realize that numerical analysis is an art, not a science.","The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is widely used for diagnosing as well as for judging the discrimination ability of different statistical models. Although theories about ROC curves have been established and computation methods and computer software are available for cross-sectional design, limited research for estimating ROC curves and their summary statistics has been done for repeated measure designs, which are useful in many applications, such as  biological, medical and health services research. Furthermore, there is no published statistical software available that can generate ROC curves and calculate summary statistics of the area under a ROC curve for data from a repeated measures design. Using generalized linear mixed model (GLMM), we estimate the predicted probabilities of the positivity of a disease or condition, and the estimated probability is then used as a bio-marker for constructing the ROC curve and computing the area under the curve. The area under a ROC curve is calculated using the Wilcoxon non-parametric approach by comparing the predicted probability of all discordant pairs of observations. The ROC curve is constructed by plotting a series of pairs of true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1- specificity) calculated from varying cuts of positivity escalated by increments of 0.005 in predicted probability. The computation software is written in SAS/IML/MACRO v8 and can be executed in any computer that has a working SAS v8 system with SAS/IML/MACRO.","This paper describes the implementation in R of a method for tabular or graphical display of terms in a complex generalised linear model. By complex, I mean a model that contains terms related by marginality or hierarchy, such as polynomial terms, or main effects and interactions. I call these tables or graphs effect displays. Effect displays are constructed by identifying high-order terms in a generalised linear model. Fitted values under the model are computed for each such term. The lower-order \"relatives\" of a high-order term (e.g., main effects marginal to an interaction) are absorbed into the term, allowing the predictors appearing in the high-order term to range over their values. The values of other predictors are fixed at typical values: for example, a covariate could be fixed at its mean or median, a factor at its proportional distribution in the data, or to equal proportions in its several levels. Variations of effect displays are also described, including representation of terms higher-order to any appearing in the model.","A software package for fitting and assessing multidimensional point process models using the R statistical computing environment is described. Methods of residual analysis based on random thinning are discussed and implemented. Features of the software are demonstrated using data on wildfire occurrences in Los Angeles County, California and earthquake occurrences in Northern California.","A variant of the boxplot is proposed in which the sides contain the information of a percentile plot (which is equivalent to the empirical cumulative distribution function). Unlike boxplots, there is no question about how long to draw the whiskers, nor is there loss of information due to grouping. Side-by-side comparisons of distributions are especially effective. In spite of including more detail, the impact on statistically-untrained readers remains similar to that of traditional boxplots.","Kolmogorov's goodness-of-fit measure, Dn , for a sample CDF has consistently been set aside for methods such as the D+n or D-n of Smirnov, primarily, it seems, because of the difficulty of computing the distribution of Dn . As far as we know, no easy way to compute that distribution has ever been provided in the 70+ years since Kolmogorov's fundamental paper. We provide one here, a C procedure that provides Pr(Dn < d) with 13-15 digit accuracy for n ranging from 2 to at least 16000. We assess the (rather slow) approach to limiting form, and because computing time can become excessive for probabilities>.999 with n's of several thousand, we provide a quick approximation that gives accuracy to the 7th digit for such cases.","Orientlib is an R package to facilitate working with orientation data, i.e. elements of S O(3). It provides automatic translation between different representations of orientations, including rotation matrices, quaternions, Euler angles and skew-symmetric matrices; it also has functions for fitting regression models and displaying orientations.  This paper reviews simple properties of orientation data and describes Orientlib.","deal is a software package for use with R. It includes several methods for analysing data using Bayesian networks with variables of discrete and/or continuous types but restricted to conditionally Gaussian networks. Construction of priors for network parameters is supported and their parameters can be learned from data using conjugate updating. The network score is used as a metric to learn the structure of the network and forms the basis of a heuristic search strategy. deal has an interface to Hugin.","Fisher's exact test (FET) is an important statistical method for testing association between two groups. However, the computations involved in FET are extremely tedious and time consuming due to multi-step factorial calculations after the construction of numerous 2x2 tables depending on the smallest cell value. A Visual-Basic computer program, CalcFisher, has been developed to handle the complexities of FET resorting the techniques of looping subroutines and logarithmic conversions. The software automatically calculates the P-value after entering the respective cell values and has been validated for proper functioning with a wide range of frequencies (tens to several thousands). The important features of the program include, easy data entry, tail-selection, comprehensive report format and the facility of printing and saving of results.","Smoothing methods that use basis functions with penalization can be formulated as fits in a mixed model framework. One of the major benefits is that software for mixed model analysis can be used for smoothing. We illustrate this for several smoothing models such as additive and varying coefficient models for both S-PLUS and SAS software. Code for each of the illustrations is available on the Internet.","Lisp-Stat seems to be quite inert nowadays. However, there is no widespread agreement about what actually killed it, or even whether it has really passed away or not. Here we present the papers included in this special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software about it. Some of the included papers are about what Lisp-Stat was able to do in the past, other give testimony of the current state of health of Lisp-Stat, and other analyze whether there is any chance of its eventual recovery. \n\nWe believe that the diagnosis performed here will appeal not only to people interested in Lisp-Stat but to all those involved in the development of statistical languages, as it provides hints as to what elements could make them succeed or fail.","Except for n = 1, only the limit as n approaches infinity for the distribution of the Anderson-Darling test for uniformity has been found, and that in so complicated a form that published values for a few percentiles had to be determined by numerical integration, saddlepoint or other approximation methods. We give here our method for evaluating that asymptotic distribution to great accuracy--directly, via series with two-term recursions. We also give, for any particular n, a procedure for evaluating the distribution to the fourth digit, based on empirical CDF's from samples of size 1010 .","The purpose of this brief note is to bring to the attention of readers a collection of Fortran routines which may be useful to readers of this journal.  The author collected the routines over many years, starting while acting as a statistical consultant in CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia). Though most statistical analysis is now done using statistical packages, code in Fortran and other languages is useful for instance when developing new tests or estimates, or for finding maximum likelihood estimates in complex cases.","A modification of the Kaiser and Dichman (1962) procedure of generating multivariate random numbers with specified intercorrelation is proposed. The procedure works with positive and non-positive definite population correlation matrix. A SAS module is also provided to run the procedure.","StatCrunch, formerly known as WebStat, is a statistical data analysis software package for the World Wide Web (WWW). After version 1.0 [1] of the software was published as a prototype package in 1997, version 2.0 was released in 1999 as a fully functional statistical software package. Version 2.0 offered an easy-to-use interface and basic statistical routines which were well suited for educational and low level research needs. The main aim of the menu driven package was to offer a freely accessible alternative to commercial statistical software via the WWW with the only minimal requirement on the part of the user being a Java capable Web browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.","In many factorial experiments where the factors have levels that are ordinal or quantitative, a researcher may predict that the mean response in certain treatments will be higher or lower than those in other treatments. One type of order that may be anticipated is called lattice order, where average response tends to increase (or decrease) as the levels of any one of the factors is increased, holding the others fixed. A Kendall-type statistic, which measures the degree of lattice order in the data, can also be used to carry out a test involving lattice-ordered means. In this article, tests for individual factors are developed to complement the overall test of lattice order, and the methods are then applied to relevant and current data. \n\nPrograms in R and FORTRAN are included to carry out the tests.","In their 1970 paper titled \"Mean and Variance Control Chart Limits Based on a Small Number of Subgroups\" (Journal of Quality Technology, Volume 2, Number 1, pp. 9-16), Yang and Hillier originally derived equations for calculating the factors required to determine second stage short run control limits for ) v,X c(  and )s ,X( c  charts. Two issues have restricted the applicability of this particular control chart methodology. These are the limited tabulated values of factors Yang and Hillier present and no example to illustrate the use of the methodology. This paper addresses the first issue by presenting a computer program that accurately calculates the factors regardless of the values of the required inputs. An example shows how to incorporate the methodology into a two stage short run control charting procedure. The computer program is available at \nhttp://program.20m.com.","I present software for analysing complex survey samples in R. The sampling scheme can be explicitly described or represented by replication weights. Variance estimation uses either replication or linearisation.","This manual details the implementation of the profile matching techniques introduced in Robust Estimation of Air-Borne Particulate Matter (Wiens, Florence and Hiltz, Environmetrics, 2001 - included as an appendix). The program consists of a collection of functions written in S. It runs in S-Plus, including the student version. A graphical user interface is supplied for easy implementation by a user with only a passing familiarity with S-Plus. A description of the software is given, together with an extensive example of an analysis of a data set using the software. \n\nThe software is available at \n\nhttp://www.stat.ualberta.ca/~wiens/publist.htm \n\nwhere it is linked to the listing for Wiens, Florence and Hiltz (2001).","In this paper we introduce and illustrate the use of an S-PLUS set of functions to fit M-type smoothing splines with the smoothing parameter chosen by a robust criterion (either a robust version of cross-validation or a robust version of Mallows's Cp ). The main reference is: Cantoni, E. and Ronchetti, E. (2001). Resistant selection of the smoothing parameter for smoothing splines. Statistics and Computing, 11, 141-146.","This paper describes how to use the Matlab software package CMregr, and also gives some limited information on the CM-estimation problem itself. For detailed information on the algorithms used in CMregr as well as extensive testings, please refer to Arslan, Edlund & Ekblom (2002) and Edlund & Ekblom (2004).","Robust statistical methods are designed to work well when classical assumptions, typically normality and/or the lack of outliers, are violated. Almost everyone agrees on the value of robust statistical procedures. Nonetheless, after more than 40 years and thousands of papers, few robust methods were available in standard statistical software packages until very recently. \n\nThis paper argues that one of the primary reasons for the lack of robust statistical methods in standard statistical software packages is the fact that few developers of statistical methods are willing to write user-friendly and readable software for the methods they develop, regardless of the usefulness of the method. Recent changes in academic statistics make it highly desirable for all developers of statistical methods to provide usable code for their statistical methods.","In this paper we show how Perl, an expressive and extensible high-level programming language, with network and ob ject-oriented programming support, can be used in processing data for statistics and statistical computing. The paper is organized in two parts. In Part I, we introduce the Perl programming language, with particular emphasis on the features that distinguish it from conventional languages. Then, using practical examples, we demonstrate how Perl's distinguishing features make it particularly well suited to perform labor intensive and sophisticated tasks ranging from the preparation of data to the writing of statistical reports. In Part II we show how Perl can be extended to perform statistical computations using modules and by \"embedding\" specialized statistical applications. We provide example on how Perl can be used to do simple statistical analyses, perform complex statistical computations involving matrix algebra and numerical optimization, and make statistical computations more easily reproducible. We also investigate the numerical and statistical reliability of various Perl statistical modules. Important computing issues such as ease of use, speed of calculation, and efficient memory usage, are also considered.","In this paper, we present a spectral analysis method based upon least square approximation. Our method deals with nonuniform sampling. It provides meaningful phase information that varies in a predictable way as the samples are shifted in time. We compare least square approximations of real and complex series, analyze their properties for sample count towards infinity as well as estimator behaviour, and show the equivalence to the discrete Fourier transform applied onto uniformly sampled data as a special case. We propose a way to deal with the undesirable side effects of nonuniform sampling in the presence of constant offsets. By using weighted least square approximation, we introduce an analogue to the Morlet wavelet transform for nonuniformly sampled data. Asymptotically fast divide-and-conquer schemes for the computation of the variants of the proposed method are presented. The usefulness is demonstrated in some relevant applications.","We describe two methods and provide C programs for generating discrete random variables with functions that are simple and fast, averaging ten times as fast as published methods and more than five times as fast as the fastest of those. We provide general procedures for implementing the two methods, as well as specific procedures for three of the most important discrete distributions: Poisson, binomial and hypergeometric.","This article provides a little table-free C function that evaluates the normal distribution with absolute error less than 8 x 10 -16 . A small extension provides relative error near the limit available in double precision: 14 to 16 digits, the limits determined mainly by the computer's ability to evaluate exp(-t) for large t. Results are compared with those provided by calls to erf or erfc functions, the best of which compare favorably, others do not, and all appear to be much more complicated than need be to get either absolute accuracy less than 10-15 or relative accuracy to the exp()-limited 14 to 16 digits. Also provided: A short history of the error function erf and its intended use, as well as, in the \"browse files\" attachment, various erf or erfc versions used for comparison.","Marsaglia (2003) has described a class of Xorshift random number generators (RNGs) with periods 2n - 1 for n = 32, 64, etc. We show that the sequences generated by these RNGs are identical to the sequences generated by certain linear feedback shift register (LFSR) generators using \"exclusive or\" (xor) operations on n-bit words, with a recurrence defined by a primitive polynomial of degree n.","The program EI provides a method of inferring individual behavior from aggregate data. It implements the statistical procedures, diagnostics, and graphics from the book A Solution to the Ecological Inference Problem: Reconstructing Individual Behavior from Aggregate Data (King 1997). \n\nEcological inference, as traditionally defined, is the process of using aggregate (i.e., \"ecological\") data to infer discrete individual-level relationships of interest when individual-level data are not available. Ecological inferences are required in political science research when individual-level surveys are unavailable (e.g., local or comparative electoral politics), unreliable (racial politics), insufficient (political geography), or infeasible (political history). They are also required in numerous areas of ma jor significance in public policy (e.g., for applying the Voting Rights Act) and other academic disciplines ranging from epidemiology and marketing to sociology and quantitative history.","The mimR package for graphical modelling in R is introduced. We present some facilities of mimR, namely those relating specifying models, editing models, fitting models and doing model search. We also discuss the entities needed for flexible graphical modelling in terms of an ob ject structure. An example about a latent variable model is presented.","FlexMix implements a general framework for fitting discrete mixtures of regression models in the R statistical computing environment: three variants of the EM algorithm can be used for parameter estimation, regressors and responses may be multivariate with arbitrary dimension, data may be grouped, e.g., to account for multiple observations per individual, the usual formula interface of the S language is used for convenient model specification, and a modular concept of driver functions allows to interface many different types of regression models. Existing drivers implement mixtures of standard linear models, generalized linear models and model-based clustering. FlexMix provides the E-step and all data handling, while the M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new models.","kernlab is an extensible package for kernel-based machine learning methods in R. It takes advantage of R's new S4 ob ject model and provides a framework for creating and using kernel-based algorithms. The package contains dot product primitives (kernels), implementations of support vector machines and the relevance vector machine, Gaussian processes, a ranking algorithm, kernel PCA, kernel CCA, and a spectral clustering algorithm. Moreover it provides a general purpose quadratic programming solver, and an incomplete Cholesky decomposition method.","Data described by econometric models typically contains autocorrelation and/or heteroskedasticity of unknown form and for inference in such models it is essential to use covariance matrix estimators that can consistently estimate the covariance of the model parameters. Hence, suitable heteroskedasticity consistent (HC) and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric literature over the last 20 years. To apply these estimators in practice, an implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools. In this paper, such an implementation in the package sandwich in the R system for statistical computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications. The toolbox contained in sandwich is extremely flexible and comprehensive, including specific functions for the most important HC and HAC estimators from the econometric literature. Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate how the functionality can be integrated into applications.","To the worker who only has a hammer, we are told, everything looks like a nail. Solutions to applied statistical problems are framed by the limitations imposed by statistical computing packages and languages. For better or worse, we can do what the packages do; we cannot do what the packages won't do. Statistical languages like R have basic tools that allow the analyst to design new hammers, but even in R we cannot build an arbitrary hammer, only ones within the limits imposed by the R language. XLISP-STAT imposes different limitations, so we can produce different hammers. \n\nIn this article, I look at some of the tools in XLISP-STAT that allow the user to think about graphics in ways that cannot be easily replicated in other statistical languages. The interactive graphical methods available in XLISP-STAT lead to very different methodology than would be developed without the tools that XLISP-STAT provides. The general approach to graphics and indeed to data analysis in general is quite different in a package like Arc that is built on top of XLISP-STAT, than it is in other statistical packages. We discuss why that might be true, and why this depends on design options created by XLISP-STAT.","Based on mixture models, we present a Bayesian method (called BClass) to classify biological entities (e.g. genes) when variables of quite heterogeneous nature are analyzed. Various statistical distributions are used to model the continuous/categorical data commonly produced by genetic experiments and large-scale genomic projects. We calculate the posterior probability of each entry to belong to each element (group) in the mixture. In this way, an original set of heterogeneous variables is transformed into a set of purely homogeneous characteristics represented by the probabilities of each entry to belong to the groups. The number of groups in the analysis is controlled dynamically by rendering the groups as 'alive' and 'dormant' depending upon the number of entities classified within them. Using standard Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms, we constructed a sampler to approximate posterior moments and grouping probabilities. Since this method does not require the definition of similarity measures, it is especially suitable for data mining and knowledge discovery in biological databases. We applied BClass to classify genes in RegulonDB, a database specialized in information about the transcriptional regulation of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli. The classification obtained is consistent with current knowledge and allowed prediction of missing values for a number of genes. \n\nBClass is object-oriented and fully programmed in Lisp-Stat. The output grouping probabilities are analyzed and interpreted using graphical (dynamically linked plots) and query-based approaches. We discuss the advantages of using Lisp-Stat as a programming language as well as the problems we faced when the data volume increased exponentially due to the ever-growing number of genomic projects.","The structure, or Hasse, diagram described by Taylor and Hilton (1981, American Statistician) provides a visual display of the relationships between factors for balanced complete experimental designs. Using the Hasse diagram, rules exist for determining the appropriate linear model, ANOVA table, expected means squares, and F-tests in the case of balanced designs. This procedure has been implemented in Lisp-Stat using a software representation of the experimental design. The user can interact with the Hasse diagram to add, change, or delete factors and see the effect on the proposed analysis. The system has potential uses in teaching and consulting.","This paper will describe my experiences in moving on from Lisp-Stat to Java to R.  I was introduced to Lisp-Stat in 1989 and used it actively for teaching and research over the next 10 years.  My use of Lisp-Stat culminated in a joint project with Hani Doss on Bayesian Sensitivity Analysis and it remains the largest piece of software I wrote using Lisp-Stat.  At the time the project was completed, the only open statistical system that could deliver the goods was Lisp-Stat.  In this article, I will describe how the power of Lisp, underlying statistical components and dynamic graphics were exploited in the project.  When development on Lisp-Stat slowed down, Java was coming into its own as an important language and R became an open source collaborative project.  Of course, I have moved on and I use R for most of my work today. I will touch upon my experience with Java and R briefly.","This paper offers a visual tour throughout ViSta 6.4, a freeware statistical program based on Lisp-Stat and focused on techniques for statistical visualization (Young 2004). This travel around ViSta is based on screen recordings that illustrate the main features of the program in action. The following aspects of ViSta 6.4 are displayed: the program's interface (ViSta's desktop, menubar and pop-up menus, help system); its data management capabilities (data input and editing, data transformations); features associated to data analysis (data description, statistical modeling); and the options for Lisp-Stat development in ViSta. The video recordings associated to this tour (.wmv files) can be visualized at http://www.jstatsoft.org/v13/i08/ using the Internet Explorer navigator, or by clicking on the figures in the paper.","We present a general framework of exploratory data analysis defining a set of concepts and prototypes developed within the Lisp-Stat programming environment for a M-to-M links multidimensional approach. We overview the main domains and fundamentals on which we lay the developed interactive GIS. In a second stage, we detail the different prototypes we implemented in a software called ARPEGE' and how they collaborate in providing an interactive spatial data exploration. Then we show four examples of concrete geographical applications and their underlaying data models. We end on a discussion about the contribution and the limitations of our conceptual framework and its associated software, and open to future research.","Lisp-Stat was originally developed as a framework for experimenting with dynamic graphics in statistics. To support this use, it evolved into a platform for more general statistical computing. The choice of the Lisp language as the basis of the system was in part coincidence and in part a very deliberate decision. This paper describes the background behind the choice of Lisp, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of this choice. The paper then discusses some lessons that can be drawn from experience with Lisp-Stat and with the R language to guide future development of Lisp-Stat, R, and similar systems.","In 1998 the UCLA Department of Statistics, which had been one of the major users of Lisp-Stat, and one of the main producers of Lisp-Stat code, decided to switch to S/R. This paper discusses why this decision was made, and what the pros and the cons were.","This paper describes the R add-on package BradleyTerry, which facilitates the specification and fitting of Bradley-Terry logit models to pair-comparison data. Included are the standard \"unstructured\" Bradley-Terry model, structured versions in which the parameters are related through a linear predictor to explanatory variables, and the possibility of an order or \"home advantage\" effect. Model fitting is either by maximum likelihood or by bias-reduced maximum likelihood in which the first-order asymptotic bias of parameter estimates is eliminated. Also provided are a simple and efficient approach to handling missing covariate data, and suitably-defined residuals for diagnostic checking of the linear predictor; these are new methodological contributions which will be discussed in greater detail elsewhere.","The R2WinBUGS package provides convenient functions to call WinBUGS from R. It automatically writes the data and scripts in a format readable by WinBUGS for processing in batch mode, which is possible since version 1.4. After the WinBUGS process has finished, it is possible either to read the resulting data into R by the package itself--which gives a compact graphical summary of inference and convergence diagnostics--or to use the facilities of the coda package for further analyses of the output. Examples are given to demonstrate the usage of this package.","In this paper we present the normalp package, a package for the statistical environment R that has a set of tools for dealing with the exponential power distribution. In this package there are functions to compute the density function, the distribution function and the quantiles from an exponential power distribution and to generate pseudo-random numbers from the same distribution. Moreover, methods concerning the estimation of the distribution parameters are described and implemented. It is also possible to estimate linear regression models when we assume the random errors distributed according to an exponential power distribution. A set of functions is designed to perform simulation studies to see the suitability of the estimators used. Some examples of use of this package are provided.","We analyze and discuss how a generic software to produce biplot graphs should be designed. We describe a data structure appropriate to include the biplot description and we specify the algorithm(s) to be used for several biplot types. We discuss the options the software should offer to the user in two different environments. In a highly interactive environment the user should be able to specify many graphical options and also to change them using the usual interactive tools. The resulting graph needs to be available in several formats, including high quality format for printing. In a web-based environment, the user submits a data file or listing together with some options specified either in a file or using a form. Then the graphic is sent back to the user in one of several possible formats according to the specifications. We review some of the already available software and we present an implementation based in XLISP-STAT. It can be run under Unix or Windows, and it is also part of a service that provides biplot graphs through the web.","We describe an add-on package for the language and environment R which allows simultaneous fitting of several non-linear regression models. The focus is on analysis of dose response curves, but the functionality is applicable to arbitrary non-linear regression models. Features of the package is illustrated in examples.","spatstat is a package for analyzing spatial point pattern data. Its functionality includes exploratory data analysis, model-fitting, and simulation. It is designed to handle realistic datasets, including inhomogeneous point patterns, spatial sampling regions of arbitrary shape, extra covariate data, and \"marks\" attached to the points of the point pattern. \n\nA unique feature of spatstat is its generic algorithm for fitting point process models to point pattern data. The interface to this algorithm is a function ppm that is strongly analogous to lm and glm. \n\nThis paper is a general description of spatstat and an introduction for new users.","The absence of user-friendly software has long been a major obstacle to the routine application of Bayesian methods in business and industry. It will only be through widespread application of the Bayesian approach to real problems that issues, such as the use of prior distributions, can be practically resolved in the same way that the choice of significance levels has been in the classical approach; although most Bayesians would hope for a much more satisfactory resolution. It is only relatively recently that any general purpose Bayesian software has been available; by far the most widely used such package is WinBUGS. Although this software has been designed to enable an extremely wide variety of models to be coded relatively easily, it is unlikely that many will bother to learn the language and its nuances unless they are already highly motivated to try Bayesian methods. This paper describes a graphical user interface, programmed by the author, which facilitates the specification of a wide class of generalised linear mixed models for analysis using WinBUGS. The program, BugsXLA (v2.1), is an Excel Add-In that not only allows the user to specify a model as one would in a package such as SAS or S-PLUS, but also aids the specification of priors and control of the MCMC run itself. Inevitably, developing a program such as this forces one to think again about such issues as choice of default priors, parameterisation and assessing convergence. I have tried to adopt currently perceived good practices, but mainly share my approach so that others can apply it and, through constructive criticism, play a small part in the ultimate development of the first Bayesian software package truly useable by the average data analyst.","We show that the short period of the uniform random number generator in the published implementation of Marsaglia and Tsang's Ziggurat method for generating random deviates can lead to poor distributions. Changing the uniform random number generator used in its implementation fixes this issue.","Suppose that a sequence of unknown parameters is observed sub ject to independent Gaussian noise. The EbayesThresh package in the S language implements a class of Empirical Bayes thresholding methods that can take advantage of possible sparsity in the sequence, to improve the quality of estimation. \n\nThe prior for each parameter in the sequence is a mixture of an atom of probability at zero and a heavy-tailed density. Within the package, this can be either a Laplace (double exponential) density or else a mixture of normal distributions with tail behavior similar to the Cauchy distribution. The mixing weight, or sparsity parameter, is chosen automatically by marginal maximum likelihood. If estimation is carried out using the posterior median, this is a random thresholding procedure; the estimation can also be carried out using other thresholding rules with the same threshold, and the package provides the posterior mean, and hard and soft thresholding, as additional options. \n\nThis paper reviews the method, and gives details (far beyond those previously published) of the calculations needed for implementing the procedures. It explains and motivates both the general methodology, and the use of the EbayesThresh package, through simulated and real data examples. When estimating the wavelet transform of an unknown function, it is appropriate to apply the method level by level to the transform of the observed data. The package can carry out these calculations for wavelet transforms obtained using various packages in R and S-PLUS. Details, including a motivating example, are presented, and the application of the method to image estimation is also explored. \n\nThe final topic considered is the estimation of a single sequence that may become progressively sparser along the sequence. An iterated least squares isotone regression method allows for the choice of a threshold that depends monotonically on the order in which the observations are made. An alternative possibility, also discussed in detail, is a particular parametric dependence of the sparsity parameter on the position in the sequence.","Tree based methods in S or R are extremely useful and popular. For simple trees and memorable variables it is easy to predict the outcome for a new case using only a standard decision tree diagram. However, for large trees or trees where the variable description is complex the decision tree diagram is often not enough. This article describes pinktoe: an R package containing two tools to assist with the semiautomatic traversal of trees. The PT tool creates a widget for each node to be visited in the tree that is needed to make a decision and permits the user to make decisions using radiobuttons. The pinktoe function generates a suite of HTML and Perl files that permit a CGI-enabled website to issue step-by-step questions to a user wishing to make a prediction using a tree.","A SAS macro for fitting an extension of the Dale (1986) regression model to bivariate ordinal data is provided. The macro is described in detail and examples from Dale (1986) and McMillan, Hanson, Bedrick, and Lapham (2005) are discussed.","We present a link that allows R, S-PLUS and Excel to call the functions in the lp_solve system. lp_solve is free software (licensed under the GNU Lesser GPL) that solves linear and mixed integer linear programs of moderate size (on the order of 10,000 variables and 50,000 constraints). R does not include this ability (though two add-on packages offer linear programs without integer variables), while S-PLUS users need to pay extra for the NuOPT library in order to solve these problems. Our link manages the interface between these statistical packages and lp_solve. \n\nExcel has a built-in add-in named Solver that is capable of solving mixed integer programs, but only with fewer than 200 variables. This link allows Excel users to handle substantially larger problems at no extra cost. While our primary concern has been the Windows operating system, the package has been tested on some Unix-type systems as well.","MNP is a publicly available R package that fits the Bayesian multinomial probit model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The multinomial probit model is often used to analyze the discrete choices made by individuals recorded in survey data. Examples where the multinomial probit model may be useful include the analysis of product choice by consumers in market research and the analysis of candidate or party choice by voters in electoral studies. The MNP software can also fit the model with different choice sets for each individual, and complete or partial individual choice orderings of the available alternatives from the choice set. The estimation is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm that is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2005).","zoo is an R package providing an S3 class with methods for indexed totally ordered observations, such as discrete irregular time series. Its key design goals are independence of a particular index/time/date class and consistency with base R and the \"ts\" class for regular time series. This paper describes how these are achieved within zoo and provides several illustrations of the available methods for \"zoo\" objects which include plotting, merging and binding, several mathematical operations, extracting and replacing data and index, coercion and NA handling. A subclass \"zooreg\" embeds regular time series into the \"zoo\" framework and thus bridges the gap between regular and irregular time series classes in R.","It is well-known that Wilcoxon procedures out perform least squares procedures when the data deviate from normality and/or contain outliers. These procedures can be generalized by introducing weights; yielding so-called weighted Wilcoxon (WW) techniques. In this paper we demonstrate how WW-estimates can be calculated using an L1 regression routine. More importantly, we present a collection of functions that can be used to implement a robust analysis of a linear model based on WW-estimates. For instance, estimation, tests of linear hypotheses, residual analyses, and diagnostics to detect differences in fits for various weighting schemes are discussed. We analyze a regression model, designed experiment, and autoregressive time series model for the sake of illustration. We have chosen to implement the suite of functions using the R statistical software package. Because R is freely available and runs on multiple platforms, WW-estimation and associated inference is now universally accessible.","Unlike S-PLUS, R does not incorporate a statistical graphical user interface (GUI), but it does include tools for building GUIs. Based on the tcltk package (which furnishes an interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit), the Rcmdr package provides a basic-statistics graphical user interface to R called the \"R Commander.\"  The design objectives of the R Commander were as follows: to support, through an easy-to-use, extensible, cross-platform GUI, the statistical functionality required for a basic-statistics course (though its current functionality has grown to include support for linear and generalized-linear models, and other more advanced features); to make it relatively difficult to do unreasonable things; and to render visible the relationship between choices made in the GUI and the R commands that they generate. The R Commander uses a simple and familiar menu/dialog-box interface. Top-level menus include File, Edit, Data, Statistics, Graphs, Models, Distributions, Tools, and Help, with the complete menu tree given in the paper. Each dialog box includes a Help button, which leads to a relevant help page. Menu and dialog-box selections generate R commands, which are recorded in a script window and are echoed, along with output, to an output window. The script window also provides the ability to edit, enter, and re-execute commands. Error messages, warnings, and some other information appear in a separate messages window. Data sets in the R Commander are simply R data frames, and can be read from attached packages or imported from files. Although several data frames may reside in memory, only one is \"active\" at any given time. There may also be an active statistical model (e.g., an R lm or glm ob ject). The purpose of this paper is to introduce and describe the use of the R Commander GUI; to describe the design and development of the R Commander; and to explain how the R Commander GUI can be extended. The second part of the paper (following a brief introduction) can serve as an introductory guide for students who will use the R Commander.","We present a set of functions in S-PLUS to implement the clustered data generalized additive marginal modelling (CDGAM) strategy proposed by Berhane and Tibshirani (1998). A variety of working correlation structures are supported, and the regression basis may include components from the family of smoothing splines.","In this paper we present an R package called bivpois for maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of bivariate and diagonal inflated bivariate Poisson regression models. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented. Inflated models allow for modelling both over-dispersion (or under-dispersion) and negative correlation and thus they are appropriate for a wide range of applications. Extensions of the algorithms for several other models are also discussed. Detailed guidance and implementation on simulated and real data sets using bivpois package is provided.","There has been much recent interest in Bayesian inference for generalized additive and related models. The increasing popularity of Bayesian methods for these and other model classes is mainly caused by the introduction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation techniques which allow realistic modeling of complex problems. This paper describes the capabilities of the free software package BayesX for estimating regression models with structured additive predictor based on MCMC inference. The program extends the capabilities of existing software for semiparametric regression included in S-PLUS, SAS, R or Stata. Many model classes well known from the literature are special cases of the models supported by BayesX. Examples are generalized additive (mixed) models, dynamic models, varying coefficient models, geoadditive models, geographically weighted regression and models for space-time regression. BayesX supports the most common distributions for the response variable. For univariate responses these are Gaussian, Binomial, Poisson, Gamma, negative Binomial, zero inflated Poisson and zero inflated negative binomial. For multicategorical responses, both multinomial logit and probit models for unordered categories of the response as well as cumulative threshold models for ordered categories can be estimated. Moreover, BayesX allows the estimation of complex continuous time survival and hazard rate models.","Cluster ensembles are collections of individual solutions to a given clustering problem which are useful or necessary to consider in a wide range of applications. The R package clue provides an extensible computational environment for creating and analyzing cluster ensembles, with basic data structures for representing partitions and hierarchies, and facilities for computing on these, including methods for measuring proximity and obtaining consensus and \"secondary\" clusterings.","Penalized splines can be viewed as BLUPs in a mixed model framework, which allows the use of mixed model software for smoothing. Thus, software originally developed for Bayesian analysis of mixed models can be used for penalized spline regression. Bayesian inference for nonparametric models enjoys the flexibility of nonparametric models and the exact inference provided by the Bayesian inferential machinery. This paper provides a simple, yet comprehensive, set of programs for the implementation of nonparametric Bayesian analysis in WinBUGS. Good mixing properties of the MCMC chains are obtained by using low-rank thin-plate splines, while simulation times per iteration are reduced employing WinBUGS specific computational tricks.","Mining frequent itemsets and association rules is a popular and well researched approach for discovering interesting relationships between variables in large databases. The R package arules presented in this paper provides a basic infrastructure for creating and manipulating input data sets and for analyzing the resulting itemsets and rules. The package also includes interfaces to two fast mining algorithms, the popular C implementations of Apriori and Eclat by Christian Borgelt. These algorithms can be used to mine frequent itemsets, maximal frequent itemsets, closed frequent itemsets and association rules.","This paper introduces the BACCO bundle of R routines for carrying out Bayesian analysis of computer code output. The bundle comprises packages emulator and calibrator, computerized implementations of the ideas of Oakley and O'Hagan (2002) and Kennedy and O'Hagan (2001a) respectively. The bundle is self-contained and fully documented R code, and includes a toy dataset that furnishes a working example of the functions. \n  \nPackage emulator carries out Bayesian emulation of computer code output; package calibrator allows the incorporation of observational data into model calibration using Bayesian techniques. \n\nThe package is then applied to a dataset taken from climate science.","The gRbase package is intended to set the framework for computer packages for data analysis using graphical models. The gRbase package is developed for the open source language, R, and is available for several platforms. The package is intended to be widely extendible and flexible so that package developers may implement further types of graphical models using the available methods. \n  \nThe gRbase package consists of a set of S version 3 classes and associated methods for representing data and models. The package is linked to the dynamicGraph package (Badsberg 2005), an interactive graphical user interface for manipulating graphs. \n\nIn this paper, we show how these building blocks can be combined and integrated with inference engines in the special cases of hierarchical loglinear models. We also illustrate how to extend the package to deal with other types of graphical models, in this case the graphical Gaussian models.","An estimate of the number of species, S , usually called species richness by ecologists, in an area is one of the basic statistics used to ascertain biological diversity. Traditionally ecologists have used the number of species observed in a sample, S0 , to estimate S , realizing that S0 is a lower bound for S . One alternative to S0 is to use a nonparametric procedure such as jackknife resampling. For species richness, a closed form of the jackknife estimator is available. Typically statistical software contains only the traditional iterative form of the jackknife estimator. The purpose of this article is to propose an S-PLUS function for calculating the noniterative first order jackknife estimator of species richness and some associated plots and statistics.","WhatIf is an R package that implements the methods for evaluating counterfactuals introduced in King and Zeng (2006a) and King and Zeng (2006b). It offers easy-to-use techniques for assessing a counterfactual's model dependence without having to conduct sensitivity testing over specified classes of models. These same methods can be used to approximate the common support of the treatment and control groups in causal inference.","Packaged statistical software for analyzing categorical, repeated measures marginal models on sample survey data with binary covariates does not appear to be available. Consequently, this report describes a customized SAS program which accomplishes such an analysis on survey data with jackknifed replicate weights for which the primary sampling unit information has been suppressed for respondent confidentiality. First, the program employs the Macro Language and the Output Delivery System (ODS) to estimate the means and covariances of indicator variables for the response variables, taking the design into account. Then, it uses PROC CATMOD and ODS, ignoring the survey design, to obtain the design matrix and hypothesis test specifications. Finally, it enters these results into another run of CATMOD, which performs automated direct input of the survey design specifications and accomplishes the appropriate analysis. This customized SAS program can be employed, with minor editing, to analyze general categorical, repeated measures marginal models on sample surveys with replicate weights. Finally, the results of our analysis accounting for the survey design are compared to the results of two alternate analyses of the same data. This comparison confirms that such alternate analyses, which do not properly account for the design, do not produce useful results.","An algorithm is presented for calculating concordance-discordance totals in a time of order N log N , where N is the number of observations, using a balanced binary search tree. These totals can be used to calculate jackknife estimates and confidence limits in the same time order for a very wide range of rank statistics, including Kendall's tau, Somers' D, Harrell's c, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the Gini coefficient, and the parameters underlying the sign and rank-sum tests. A Stata package is introduced for calculating confidence intervals for these rank statistics using this algorithm, which has been implemented in the Mata compilable matrix programming language supplied with Stata.","This paper describes the core features of the R package geepack, which implements the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach for fitting marginal generalized linear models to clustered data. Clustered data arise in many applications such as longitudinal data and repeated measures. The GEE approach focuses on models for the mean of the correlated observations within clusters without fully specifying the joint distribution of the observations. It has been widely used in statistical practice. This paper illustrates the application of the GEE approach with geepack through an example of clustered binary \ndata.","This paper introduces the elliptic package of R routines, for numerical calculation of elliptic and related functions. Elliptic functions furnish interesting and instructive examples of many ideas of complex analysis, and the package illustrates these numerically and visually. A statistical application in fluid mechanics is presented.","Visualization of spatial data on a map aids not only in data exploration but also in communication to impart spatial conception or ideas to others. Although recent carto-graphic functions in R are rapidly becoming richer, proportional symbol mapping, which is one of the common mapping approaches, has not been packaged thus far. Based on the theories of proportional symbol mapping developed in cartography, the authors developed some functions for proportional symbol mapping using R, including mathematical and perceptual scaling. An example of these functions demonstrated the new expressive power and options available in R, particularly for the visualization of conceptual point data.","We describe some functions in the R package ggm to derive from a given Markov model, represented by a directed acyclic graph, different types of graphs induced after marginalizing over and conditioning on some of the variables. The package has a few basic functions that find the essential graph, the induced concentration and covariance graphs, and several types of chain graphs implied by the directed acyclic graph (DAG) after grouping and reordering the variables. These functions can be useful to explore the impact of latent variables or of selection effects on a chosen data generating model.","Being among the most popular and efficient classification and regression methods currently available, implementations of support vector machines exist in almost every popular programming language. Currently four R packages contain SVM related software. The purpose of this paper is to present and compare these implementations.","The core of the wavelet approach to nonparametric regression is thresholding of wavelet coefficients. This paper reviews a cross-validation method for the selection of the thresholding value in wavelet shrinkage of Oh, Kim, and Lee (2006), and introduces the R package CVThresh implementing details of the calculations for the procedures.\n\nThis procedure is implemented by coupling a conventional cross-validation with a fast imputation method, so that it overcomes a limitation of data length, a power of 2. It can be easily applied to the classical leave-one-out cross-validation and K-fold cross-validation. Since the procedure is computationally fast, a level-dependent cross-validation can be developed for wavelet shrinkage of data with various sparseness according to levels.","We provide a language for formulating a range of state space models with response densities within the exponential family. The described methodology is implemented in the R-package sspir. A state space model is specified similarly to a generalized linear model in R, and then the time-varying terms are marked in the formula. Special functions for specifying polynomial time trends, harmonic seasonal patterns, unstructured seasonal patterns and time-varying covariates can be used in the formula. The model is fitted to data using iterated extended Kalman filtering, but the formulation of models does not depend on the implemented method of inference. The package is demonstrated on three datasets.","Complex medical disorders, such as heart disease and diabetes, are thought to involve a number of genes which act in conjunction with lifestyle and environmental factors to increase disease susceptibility. Associations between complex traits and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genomic regions can provide a useful tool for identifying genetic risk factors. However, analysis of trait associations with single SNPs ignores the potential for extra information from haplotypes, combinations of variants at multiple SNPs along a chromosome inherited from a parent. When haplotype-trait associations are of interest and haplotypes of individuals can be determined, generalized linear models (GLMs) may be used to investigate haplotype associations while adjusting for the effects of non-genetic cofactors or attributes. Unfortunately, haplotypes cannot always be determined cost-effectively when data is collected on unrelated subjects. Uncertain haplotypes may be inferred on the basis of data from single SNPs. However, subsequent analyses of risk factors must account for the resulting uncertainty in haplotype assignment in order to avoid potential errors in interpretation. To account for such uncertainty, we have developed hapassoc, software for R implementing a likelihood approach to inference of haplotype and non-genetic effects in GLMs of trait associations. We provide a description of the underlying statistical method and illustrate the use of hapassoc with examples that highlight the flexibility to specify dominant and recessive effects of genetic risk factors, a feature not shared by other software that restricts users to additive effects only.  Additionally, hapassoc can accommodate missing SNP genotypes for limited numbers of subjects.","A set of FORTRAN subprograms is presented to compute density and cumulative distribution functions and critical values for the range ratio statistics of Dixon (1951, The Annals of Mathematical Statistics ) These statistics are useful for detection of outliers in small samples.","A modification of an accept-and-reject algorithm to sample from a set of restricted permutations is proposed. By concentrating on a special class of matrices obtained by restriction of the permutation in time, assuming the objects to be permuted to be events in time, the modified algorithm's running time can be shown to be linear instead of geometric in the number of elements. The implementation of the algorithm in the language R is presented in a Literate Programming style.","Recently, new nonparametric multivariate extensions of the univariate sign methods have been proposed. Randles (2000) introduced an affine invariant multivariate sign test for the multivariate location problem. Later on, Hettmansperger and Randles (2002) considered an affine equivariant multivariate median corresponding to this test. The new methods have promising efficiency and robustness properties. In this paper, we review these developments and compare them with the classical multivariate analysis of variance model. A new SAS/IML tool for performing a spatial sign based multivariate analysis of variance is introduced.","A computational tool for testing for a dose-related trend and/or a pairwise difference in the incidence of an occult tumor via an age-adjusted bootstrap-based poly-k test and the original poly-k test is presented in this paper. The poly-k test (Bailer and Portier 1988) is a survival-adjusted Cochran-Armitage test, which achieves robustness to effects of differential mortality across dose groups. The original poly-k test is asymptotically standard normal under the null hypothesis. However, the asymptotic normality is not valid if there is a deviation from the tumor onset distribution that is assumed in this test. Our age-adjusted bootstrap-based poly-k test assesses the significance of assumed asymptotic normal tests and investigates an empirical distribution of the original poly-k test statistic using an age-adjusted bootstrap method. A tumor of interest is an occult tumor for which the time to onset is not directly observable. Since most of the animal carcinogenicity studies are designed with a single terminal sacrifice, the present tool is applicable to rodent tumorigenicity assays that have a single terminal sacrifice. The present tool takes input information simply from a user screen and reports testing results back to the screen through a user-interface. The computational tool is implemented in C/C++ and is applied to analyze a real data set as an example. Our tool enables the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry to implement a statistical analysis of tumorigenicity data from animal bioassays via our age-adjusted bootstrap-based poly-k test and the original poly-k test which has been adopted by the National Toxicology Program as its standard statistical test.","Sandwich covariance matrix estimators are a popular tool in applied regression modeling for performing inference that is robust to certain types of model misspecification. Suitable implementations are available in the R system for statistical computing for certain model fitting functions only (in particular lm()), but not for other standard regression functions, such as glm(), nls(), or survreg().  Therefore, conceptual tools and their translation to computational tools in the package sandwich are discussed, enabling the computation of sandwich estimators in general parametric models. Object orientation can be achieved by providing a few extractor functions' most importantly for the empirical estimating functions' from which various types of sandwich estimators can be computed.","We consider here the problem of computing the mean vector and covariance matrix for a conditional normal distribution, considering especially a sequence of problems where the conditioning variables are changing. The sweep operator provides one simple general approach that is easy to implement and update. A second, more goal-oriented general method avoids explicit computation of the vector and matrix, while enabling easy evaluation of the conditional density for likelihood computation or easy generation from the conditional distribution. The covariance structure that arises from the special case of an ARMA(p, q) time series can be exploited for substantial improvements in computational efficiency.","Relative importance is a topic that has seen a lot of interest in recent years, particularly in applied work. The R package relaimpo implements six different metrics for assessing relative importance of regressors in the linear model, two of which are recommended - averaging over orderings of regressors and a newly proposed metric (Feldman 2005) called pmvd. Apart from delivering the metrics themselves, relaimpo also provides (exploratory) bootstrap confidence intervals. This paper offers a brief tutorial introduction to the package.  The methods and relaimpo's functionality are illustrated using the data set swiss that is generally available in R. The paper targets readers who have a basic understanding of multiple linear regression. For the background of more advanced aspects, references are provided.","Item Tree Analysis (ITA) is an explorative method of data analysis which can be used to establish a hierarchical structure on a set of dichotomous items from a questionnaire or test. There are currently two different algorithms available to perform an ITA. We describe a computer program called ITA 2.0 which implements both of these algorithms.  In addition we show with a concrete data set how the program can be used for the analysis of questionnaire data.","Boosting is an iterative algorithm that combines simple classification rules with \"mediocre\" performance in terms of misclassification error rate to produce a highly accurate classification rule. Stochastic gradient boosting provides an enhancement which incorporates a random mechanism at each boosting step showing an improvement in performance and speed in generating the ensemble. ada is an R package that implements three popular variants of boosting, together with a version of stochastic gradient boosting. In addition, useful plots for data analytic purposes are provided along with an extension to the multi-class case. The algorithms are illustrated with synthetic and real data sets.","The need for hands-on computer laboratory experience in undergraduate and graduate statistics education has been firmly established in the past decade. As a result a number of attempts have been undertaken to develop novel approaches for problem-driven statistical thinking, data analysis and result interpretation. In this paper we describe an integrated educational web-based framework for: interactive distribution modeling, virtual online probability experimentation, statistical data analysis, visualization and integration. Following years of experience in statistical teaching at all college levels using established licensed statistical software packages, like STATA, S-PLUS, R, SPSS, SAS, Systat, etc., we have attempted to engineer a new statistics education environment, the Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR). This resource performs many of the standard types of statistical analysis, much like other classical tools. In addition, it is designed in a plug-in object-oriented architecture and is completely platform independent, web-based, interactive, extensible and secure. Over the past 4 years we have tested, fine-tuned and reanalyzed the SOCR framework in many of our undergraduate and graduate probability and statistics courses and have evidence that SOCR resources build student's intuition and enhance their learning.","This paper describes the \"strucplot\" framework for the visualization of multi-way contingency tables. Strucplot displays include hierarchical conditional plots such as mosaic, association, and sieve plots, and can be combined into more complex, specialized plots for visualizing conditional independence, GLMs, and the results of independence tests. The framework's modular design allows flexible customization of the plots' graphical appearance, including shading, labeling, spacing, and legend, by means of \"graphical appearance control\" functions. The framework is provided by the R package vcd.","This paper deals with the R-php statistical software, that is an environment for statistical analysis, freely accessible and attainable through the World Wide Web, based on R. Indeed, this software uses, as \"engine\" for statistical analyses, R via PHP and its design has been inspired by a paper of de Leeuw (1997). R-php is based on two modules: a base module and a point-and-click module. R-php base allows the simple editing of R code in a form. R-php point-and-click allows some statistical analyses by means of a graphical user interface (GUI): then, to use this module it is not necessary for the user to know the R environment, but all the allowed analyses can be performed by using the computer mouse. We think that this tool could be particularly useful for teaching purposes: one possible use could be in a University computer laboratory to permit a smooth approach of students to R.","This paper describes graphical methods for multiple-response data within the framework of the multivariate linear model (MLM), aimed at understanding what is being tested in a multivariate test, and how factor/predictor effects are expressed across multiple response measures.  In particular, we describe and illustrate a collection of SAS macro programs for: (a) Data ellipses and low-rank biplots for multivariate data, (b) HE plots, showing the hypothesis and error covariance matrices for a given pair of responses, and a given effect, (c) HE plot matrices, showing all pairwise HE plots, and (d) low-rank analogs of HE plots, showing all observations, group means, and their relations to the response variables.","This manuscript overviews exact testing of goodness of fit for log-linear models using the R package exactLoglinTest. This package evaluates model fit for Poisson log-linear models by conditioning on minimal sufficient statistics to remove nuisance parameters. A Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed to estimate P values from the resulting conditional distribution. In particular, this package implements a sequentially rounded normal approximation and importance sampling to approximate probabilities from the conditional distribution. Usually, this results in a high percentage of valid samples. However, in instances where this is not the case, a Metropolis Hastings algorithm can be implemented that makes more localized jumps within the reference set. The manuscript details how some conditional tests for binomial logit models can also be viewed as conditional Poisson log-linear models and hence can be performed via exactLoglinTest. A diverse battery of examples is considered to highlight use, features and extensions of the software. Notably, potential extensions to evaluating disclosure risk are also considered.","The R package ltm has been developed for the analysis of multivariate dichotomous and polytomous data using latent variable models, under the Item Response Theory approach.  For dichotomous data the Rasch, the Two-Parameter Logistic, and Birnbaum's Three-Parameter models have been implemented, whereas for polytomous data Semejima's Graded Response model is available. Parameter estimates are obtained under marginal maximum likelihood using the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule. The capabilities and features of the package are illustrated using two real data examples.","In a variety of settings it is extremely helpful to be able to apply R functions through buttons, sliders and other types of graphical control. This is particularly true in plotting activities where immediate communication between such controls and a graphical display allows the user to interact with a plot in a very effective manner. The tcltk package provides extensive tools for this and the aim of the rpanel package is to provide simple and well documented functions which make these facilities as accessible as possible. In addition, the operations which form the basis of communication within tcltk are managed in a way which allows users to write functions with a more standard form of parameter passing. This paper describes the basic design of the software and illustrates it on a variety of examples of interactive control of graphics. The tkrplot system is used to allow plots to be integrated with controls into a single panel. An example of the use of a graphical image, and the ability to interact with this, is also discussed.","The pls package implements principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) in R (R Development Core Team 2006b), and is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL). The user interface is modelled after the traditional formula interface, as exemplified by lm. This was done so that people used to R would not have to learn yet another interface, and also because we believe the formula interface is a good way of working interactively with models. It thus has methods for generic functions like predict, update and coef. It also has more specialised functions like scores, loadings and RMSEP, and a exible crossvalidation system. Visual inspection and assessment is important in chemometrics, and the pls package has a number of plot functions for plotting scores, loadings, predictions, coefficients and RMSEP estimates.  The package implements PCR and several algorithms for PLSR. The design is modular, so that it should be easy to use the underlying algorithms in other functions. It is our hope that the package will serve well both for interactive data analysis and as a building block for other functions or packages using PLSR or PCR.  We will here describe the package and how it is used for data analysis, as well as how it can be used as a part of other packages. Also included is a section about formulas and data frames, for people not used to the R modelling idioms.","TIMP is an R package for modeling multiway spectroscopic measurements. The package allows for the simultaneous analysis of datasets collected under different experimental conditions in terms of a wide variety of parametric models. Models arising in spectroscopy data analysis often have some parameters that are intrinstically nonlinear, and some parameters that are conditionally linear on estimates of the nonlinear parameters. TIMP fits such separable nonlinear models using partitioned variable projection, a variant of the variable projection algorithm that is described here for the first time. The of the partitioned variable projection algorithm allows fitting many models for spectroscopy datasets using much less memory as compared to under the standard variable projection algorithm that is implemented in nonlinear optimization routines (e.g., the plinear option of the R function nls), as is shown here. An overview of modeling with TIMP is also given that includes several case studies in the application of the package.","Proteomics is the study of the abundance, function and dynamics of all proteins present in a living organism, and mass spectrometry (MS) has become its most important tool due to its unmatched sensitivity, resolution and potential for high-throughput experimentation.  A frequently used variant of mass spectrometry is coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) and is denoted as \"LC/MS\". It produces two-dimensional raw data, where significant distortions along one of the dimensions can occur between different runs on the same instrument, and between instruments. A compensation of these distortions is required to allow for comparisons between and inference based on different experiments. This article introduces the amsrpm software package. It implements a variant of the Robust Point Matching (RPM) algorithm that is tailored for the alignment of LC and LC/MS experiments. Problem-specific enhancements include a specialized dissimilarity measure, and means to enforce smoothness and monotonicity of the estimated transformation function. The algorithm does not rely on pre-specified landmarks, it is insensitive towards outliers and capable of modeling nonlinear distortions. Its usefulness is demonstrated using both simulated and experimental data. The software is available as an open source package for the statistical programming language R.","The flexibility and scope of the R programming environment has made it a popular choice for statistical modeling and scientific prototyping in a number of fields. In the field of chemistry, R provides several tools for a variety of problems related to statistical modeling of chemical information. However, one aspect common to these tools is that they do not have direct access to the information that is available from chemical structures, such as contained in molecular descriptors.\n\nWe describe the rcdk package that provides the R user with access to the CDK, a Java framework for cheminformatics. As a result, it is possible to read in a variety of molecular formats, calculate molecular descriptors and evaluate fingerprints. In addition, we describe the rpubchem that will allow access to the data in PubChem, a public repository of molecular structures and associated assay data for approximately 8 million compounds.  Currently, the package allows access to structural information as well as some simple molecular properties from PubChem. In addition the package allows access to bio-assay data from the PubChem FTP servers.","Due to recent advances in methods and software for model-based clustering, and to the interpretability of the results, clustering procedures based on probability models are increasingly preferred over heuristic methods. The clustering process estimates a model for the data that allows for overlapping clusters, producing a probabilistic clustering that quantifies the uncertainty of observations belonging to components of the mixture. The resulting clustering model can also be used for some other important problems in multivariate analysis, including density estimation and discriminant analysis. Examples of the use of model-based clustering and classification techniques in chemometric studies include multivariate image analysis, magnetic resonance imaging, microarray image segmentation, statistical process control, and food authenticity. We review model-based clustering and related methods for density estimation and discriminant analysis, and show how the R package mclust can be applied in each instance.","The representation of biochemical knowledge in terms of fluxes (transformation rates) in a metabolic network is often a crucial step in the development of new drugs and efficient bioreactors. Mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS) in combination with 13C labeled substrates are experimental techniques resulting in data that may be used to quantify fluxes in the metabolic network underlying a process. The massive amount of data generated by spectroscopic experiments increasingly requires software which models the dynamics of the underlying biological system.  In this work we present an approach to handle isotopomer distributions in metabolic networks using an object-oriented programming approach, implemented using S4 classes in R. The developed package is called FluxSimulator and provides a user friendly interface to specify the topological information of the metabolic network as well as carbon atom transitions in plain text files. The package automatically derives the mathematical representation of the formulated network, and assembles a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the change of each isotopomer pool over time. These ODEs are subsequently solved numerically.  In a case study FluxSimulator was applied to an example network. Our results indicate that the package is able to reproduce exact changes in isotopomer compositions of the metabolite pools over time at given flux rates.","Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) allows fluorescence lifetime images of biological objects to be collected at 250 nm spatial resolution and at (sub-)nanosecond temporal resolution. Often ncomp kinetic processes underlie the observed fluorescence at all locations, but the intensity of the fluorescence associated with each process varies per-location, i.e., per-pixel imaged. Then the statistical challenge is global analysis of the image: use of the fluorescence decay in time at all locations to estimate the  ncomp lifetimes associated with the kinetic processes, as well as the amplitude of each kinetic process at each location. Given that typical FLIM images represent on the order of 102 timepoints and 103 locations, meeting this challenge is computationally intensive. Here the utility of the TIMP package for R to solve parameter estimation problems arising in FLIM image analysis is demonstrated. Case studies on simulated and real data evidence the applicability of the partitioned variable projection algorithm implemented in TIMP to the problem domain, and showcase options included in the package for the visual validation of models for FLIM data.","spectrino is a spectra preparation software utility for the R language and environment for statistical computing. It is an operating-system specific tool, for use under Microsoft Windows, with specialized visualization, organization and preprocessing features for spectra.  The software accepts spectral data from analytical instruments and then prepares a data structure to be introduced in R. spectrino has a rich set of features to create data structures and visually manipulate/compare spectra. The application is accessible by a library of functions from within R. These commands allow for the creation and manipulation of data structures in spectrino and the selective extraction of spectral data.  Before exporting, the spectra are preprocessed according the requirements of consecutive discriminant analysis. This preprocessing is adjustable by a series of options.","We describe here an online software suite VOStat written mainly for the Virtual Observatory, a novel structure in which astronomers share terabyte scale data. Written mostly in the public-domain statistical computing language and environment R, it can do a variety of statistical analysis on multidimensional, multi-epoch data with errors.  Included are techniques which allow astronomers to start with multi-color data in the form of low-resolution spectra and select special kinds of sources in a variety of ways including color outliers. Here we describe the tool and demonstrate it with an example from Palomar-QUEST, a synoptic sky survey.","HPLC-DAD systems generate time intensity (absorbance) matrices called spectrochromatograms.  Under good experimental conditions, spectro-chromatograms of elution peaks of pure analytes are bilinear products of a time peak and an absorbance spectrum.  Co-eluting impurities create deviations from this pure bilinear structure. Unfortunately, other imperfections, such as scan averaging, large optical windows, imperfect lamp alignment, mobile phase fluctuations, etc. also create departures from the pure bilinear structure.  This makes it hard to distinguish low concentration impurities from artifacts and hampers safe detection of contaminants. There are two main ways to deal with such artifacts: removal and simulation, and ImpuR provides R functions to do both and to integrate both approaches.  More specifically, ImpuR provides a set of tools to explore time-intensity matrices with respect to their bilinear structure and departures from it. It includes exploratory graphs for bilinear matrices (bilinear residual graphs and singular value decompositions), spectral dissimilarity curves via window-evolving factor analysis with heteroscedasticity correction and the sine method, methods for removal of artifacts, and a comprehensive simulation tool to assess the impact of potential artifacts and to allow for the construction of guide curves for use with the sine method.","This special volume collates ten issues under the rubric \"Spectroscopy and Chemometrics in R\". In so doing, it provides an overview of the breadth, depth and state of the art of R-based software projects for spectroscopy and chemometrics applications. Just as the authors have contributed to R their documentation and source code, so has R contributed to the quality, standardization and dissemination of their software, as this volume attests. We hope that the volume is inspiring to both computational statisticians interested in applications of their methodologies and to spectroscopists or chemometricians in need of solutions to their data analysis problems.","Carefully designed Java applications turn out to be efficient and platform independent tools that can compete well with classical implementations of statistical software. The project presented here is an example underlining this statement for random variate generation. An end-user application called RAGE (Random Variate Generator) is developed to generate random variates from probability distributions. A Java class library called JDiscreteLib has been designed and implemented for the simulation of random variables from the most usual discrete distributions inside RAGE. For each distribution, specific and general algorithms are available for this purpose. RAGE can also be used as an interactive simulation tool for data and data summary visualization.","The Rasch family of models considered in this paper includes models for polytomous items and multiple correlated latent traits, as well as for dichotomous items and a single latent variable. An R package is described that computes estimates of parameters and robust standard errors of a class of log-linear-by-linear association (LLLA) models, which are derived from a Rasch family of models. The LLLA models are special cases of log-linear models with bivariate interactions. Maximum likelihood estimation of LLLA models in this form is limited to relatively small problems; however, pseudo-likelihood estimation overcomes this limitation. Maximizing the pseudo-likelihood function is achieved by maximizing the likelihood of a single conditional multinomial logistic regression model.  The parameter estimates are asymptotically normal and consistent. Based on our simulation studies, the pseudo-likelihood and maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of LLLA models are nearly identical and the loss of efficiency is negligible. Recovery of parameters of Rasch models fit to simulated data is excellent.","Traditional Rasch estimation of the item and student parameters via marginal maximum likelihood, joint maximum likelihood or conditional maximum likelihood, assume individuals in clustered settings are uncorrelated and items within a test that share a grouping structure are also uncorrelated. These assumptions are often violated, particularly in educational testing situations, in which students are grouped into classrooms and many test items share a common grouping structure, such as a content strand or a reading passage. Consequently, one possible approach is to explicitly recognize the clustered nature of the data and directly incorporate random effects to account for the various dependencies.  This article demonstrates how the multilevel Rasch model can be estimated using the functions in R for mixed-effects models with crossed or partially crossed random effects. We demonstrate how to model the following hierarchical data structures: a) individuals clustered in similar settings (e.g., classrooms, schools), b) items nested within a particular group (such as a content strand or a reading passage), and c) how to estimate a teacher x content strand interaction.","We describe an implementation of simple, multiple and joint correspondence analysis in R. The resulting package comprises two parts, one for simple correspondence analysis and one for multiple and joint correspondence analysis. Within each part, functions for computation, summaries and visualization in two and three dimensions are provided, including options to display supplementary points and perform subset analyses. Special emphasis has been put on the visualization functions that offer features such as different scaling options for biplots and three-dimensional maps using the rgl package. Graphical options include shading and sizing plot symbols for the points according to their contributions to the map and masses respectively.","The Rasch sampler is an efficient algorithm to sample binary matrices with given marginal sums. It is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The program can handle matrices of up to 1024 rows and 64 columns. A special option allows to sample square matrices with given marginals and fixed main diagonal, a problem prominent in social network analysis. In all cases the stationary distribution is uniform. The user has control on the serial dependency.","Variance component models are generally accepted for the analysis of hierarchical structured data. A shortcoming is that outcome variables are still treated as measured without an error. Unreliable variables produce biases in the estimates of the other model parameters. The variability of the relationships across groups and the group-effects on individuals' outcomes differ substantially when taking the measurement error in the dependent variable of the model into account. The multilevel model can be extended to handle measurement error using an item response theory (IRT) model, leading to a multilevel IRT model. This extended multilevel model is in particular suitable for the analysis of educational response data where students are nested in schools and schools are nested within cities/countries.","In computerized testing, the test takers' responses as well as their response times on the items are recorded. The relationship between response times and response accuracies is complex and varies over levels of observation. For example, it takes the form of a tradeoff between speed and accuracy at the level of a fixed person but may become a positive correlation for a population of test takers. In order to explore such relationships and test hypotheses about them, a conjoint model is proposed. Item responses are modeled by a two-parameter normal-ogive IRT model and response times by a lognormal model. The two models are combined using a hierarchical framework based on the fact that response times and responses are nested within individuals. All parameters can be estimated simultaneously using an MCMC estimation approach. A R-package for the MCMC algorithm is presented and explained.","The behavioral, educational, and social sciences are undergoing a paradigmatic shift in methodology, from disciplines that focus on the dichotomous outcome of null hypothesis significance tests to disciplines that report and interpret effect sizes and their corresponding confidence intervals. Due to the arbitrariness of many measurement instruments used in the behavioral, educational, and social sciences, some of the most widely reported effect sizes are standardized. Although forming confidence intervals for standardized effect sizes can be very beneficial, such confidence interval procedures are generally difficult to implement because they depend on noncentral t, F, and x2 distributions.  At present, no main-stream statistical package provides exact confidence intervals for standardized effects without the use of specialized programming scripts. Methods for the Behavioral, Educational, and Social Sciences (MBESS) is an R package that has routines for calculating confidence intervals for noncentral t, F, and x2 distributions, which are then used in the calculation of exact confidence intervals for standardized effect sizes by using the confidence interval transformation and inversion principles. The present article discusses the way in which confidence intervals are formed for standardized effect sizes and illustrates how such confidence intervals can be easily formed using MBESS in R.","Item response theory models (IRT) are increasingly becoming established in social science research, particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data in psychology, education, medicine, marketing and other fields where testing is relevant. We propose the R package eRm (extended Rasch modeling) for computing Rasch models and several extensions.  A main characteristic of some IRT models, the Rasch model being the most prominent, concerns the separation of two kinds of parameters, one that describes qualities of the subject under investigation, and the other relates to qualities of the situation under which the response of a subject is observed. Using conditional maximum likelihood (CML) estimation both types of parameters may be estimated independently from each other.  IRT models are well suited to cope with dichotomous and polytomous responses, where the response categories may be unordered as well as ordered. The incorporation of linear structures allows for modeling the effects of covariates and enables the analysis of repeated categorical measurements.  The eRm package fits the following models: the Rasch model, the rating scale model (RSM), and the partial credit model (PCM) as well as linear reparameterizations through covariate structures like the linear logistic test model (LLTM), the linear rating scale model (LRSM), and the linear partial credit model (LPCM). We use an unitary, efficient CML approach to estimate the item parameters and their standard errors. Graphical and numeric tools for assessing goodness-of-fit are provided.","Item response theory (IRT) models are a class of statistical models used by researchers to describe the response behaviors of individuals to a set of categorically scored items. The most common IRT models can be classified as generalized linear fixed- and/or mixed-effect models. Although IRT models appear most often in the psychological testing literature, researchers in other fields have successfully utilized IRT-like models in a wide variety of applications. This paper discusses the three major methods of estimation in IRT and develops R functions utilizing the built-in capabilities of the R environment to find the marginal maximum likelihood estimates of the generalized partial credit model. The currently available R packages ltm is also discussed.","Mokken scale analysis (MSA) is a scaling procedure for both dichotomous and polytomous items. It consists of an item selection algorithm to partition a set of items into Mokken scales and several methods to check the assumptions of two nonparametric item response theory models: the monotone homogeneity model and the double monotonicity model. First, we present an R package mokken for MSA and explain the procedures.  Second, we show how to perform MSA in R using test data obtained with the Adjective Checklist.","One of the most widely used goodness-of-fit tests is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) family of tests which have been implemented by many computer statistical software packages. To calculate a p value (evaluate the cumulative sampling distribution), these packages use various methods including recursion formulae, limiting distributions, and approximations of unknown accuracy developed over thirty years ago. Based on an extensive literature search for the one-sided one-sample K-S test, this paper identifies two direct formulae and five recursion formulae that can be used to calculate a p value and then develops two additional direct formulae and four iterative versions of the direct formulae for a total of thirteen formulae. To ensure accurate calculation by avoiding catastrophic cancelation and eliminating rounding error, each formula is implemented in rational arithmetic. Linear search is used to calculate the inverse of the cumulative sampling distribution (find the confidence interval bandwidth). Extensive tables of bandwidths are presented for sample sizes up to 2, 000. The results confirm the hypothesis that as the number of digits in the numerator and denominator integers of the rational number test statistic increases, the computation time also increases. In comparing the computational times of the thirteen formulae, the direct formulae are slightly faster than their iterative versions and much faster than all the recursion formulae. Computational times for the fastest formula are given for sample sizes up to fifty thousand.","Digital imaging has become omnipresent in the past years with a bulk of applications ranging from medical imaging to photography. When pushing the limits of resolution and sensitivity noise has ever been a major issue. However, commonly used non-adaptive filters can do noise reduction at the cost of a reduced effective spatial resolution only.  Here we present a new package adimpro for R, which implements the propagationseparation approach by (Polzehl and Spokoiny 2006) for smoothing digital images. This method naturally adapts to different structures of different size in the image and thus avoids oversmoothing edges and fine structures. We extend the method for imaging data with spatial correlation. Furthermore we show how the estimation of the dependence between variance and mean value can be included. We illustrate the use of the package through some examples.","This article introduces Rcapture, an R package for capture-recapture experiments.  The data for analysis consists of the frequencies of the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three types of models.  With a closed population model, the goal of the analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on the way in which the capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture features several models for these capture probabilities that lead to different estimators for N. In an open population model, immigration and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling; closed population models apply within primary periods and an open population model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates; their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack for open population models.","The spectral representation of stationary Gaussian processes via the Fourier basis provides a computationally efficient specification of spatial surfaces and nonparametric regression functions for use in various statistical models. I describe the representation in detail and introduce the spectralGP package in R for computations. Because of the large number of basis coefficients, some form of shrinkage is necessary; I focus on a natural Bayesian approach via a particular parameterized prior structure that approximates stationary Gaussian processes on a regular grid. I review several models from the literature for data that do not lie on a grid, suggest a simple model modification, and provide example code demonstrating MCMC sampling using the spectralGP package. I describe reasons that mixing can be slow in certain situations and provide some suggestions for MCMC techniques to improve mixing, also with example code, and some general recommendations grounded in experience.","This paper provides the requisite information and description of software that perform numerical computations and graphics for the power method polynomial transformation.  The software developed is written in the Mathematica 5.2 package PowerMethod.m and is associated with fifth-order polynomials that are used for simulating univariate and multivariate non-normal distributions. The package is flexible enough to allow a user the choice to model theoretical pdfs, empirical data, or a user's own selected distribution(s).  The primary functions perform the following (a) compute standardized cumulants and polynomial coefficients, (b) ensure that polynomial transformations yield valid pdfs, and (c) graph power method pdfs and cdfs. Other functions compute cumulative probabilities, modes, trimmed means, intermediate correlations, or perform the graphics associated with fitting power method pdfs to either empirical or theoretical distributions. Numerical examples and Monte Carlo results are provided to demonstrate and validate the use of the software package. The notebook Demo.nb is also provided as a guide for user of the power method.","Scientists and investigators in such diverse fields as geological and environmental sciences, ecology, forestry, disease mapping, and economics often encounter spatially referenced data collected over a fixed set of locations with coordinates (latitude-longitude, Easting-Northing etc.) in a region of study. Such point-referenced or geostatistical data are often best analyzed with Bayesian hierarchical models. Unfortunately, fitting such models involves computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods whose efficiency depends upon the specific problem at hand. This requires extensive coding on the part of the user and the situation is not helped by the lack of available software for such algorithms. Here, we introduce a statistical software package, spBayes, built upon the R statistical computing platform that implements a generalized template encompassing a wide variety of Gaussian spatial process models for univariate as well as multivariate point-referenced data. We discuss the algorithms behind our package and illustrate its use with a synthetic and real data example.","This special volume presents a select number of psychometric techniques, many of them original, and their implementation in R packages.","SASweave is a collection of scripts that allow one to embed SAS code into a LATEX document, and automatically incorporate the results as well. SASweave is patterned after Sweave, which does the same thing for code written in R. In fact, a document may contain both SAS and R code. Besides the convenience of being able to easily incorporate SAS examples in a document, SASweave facilitates the concept of \"literate programming\": having code, documentation, and results packaged together. Among other things, this helps to ensure that the SAS output in the document is in concordance with the code.","Missing data is a common problem in survey based research. There are many packages that compensate for missing data but few can easily compensate for missing longitudinal data. WinBUGS compensates for missing data using multiple imputation, and is able to incorporate longitudinal structure using random effects. We demonstrate the superiority of longitudinal imputation over cross-sectional imputation using WinBUGS. We use example data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. We give a SAS macro that uses WinBUGS to analyze longitudinal models with missing covariate date, and demonstrate its use in a longitudinal study of terminal cancer patients and their carers.","The tgp package for R is a tool for fully Bayesian nonstationary, semiparametric nonlinear regression and design by treed Gaussian processes with jumps to the limiting linear model. Special cases also implemented include Bayesian linear models, linear CART, stationary separable and isotropic Gaussian processes. In addition to inference and posterior prediction, the package supports the (sequential) design of experiments under these models paired with several objective criteria. 1-d and 2-d plotting, with higher dimension projection and slice capabilities, and tree drawing functions (requiring maptree and combinat packages), are also provided for visualization of tgp objects.","This paper provides an introduction to a software package called waved making available all code necessary for reproducing the figures in the recently published articles on the WaveD transform for wavelet deconvolution of noisy signals. The forward WaveD transforms and their inverses can be computed using any wavelet from the Meyer family. The WaveD coefficients can be depicted according to time and resolution in several ways for data analysis. The algorithm which implements the translation invariant WaveD transform takes full advantage of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and runs in O(n(log n)2)steps only. The waved package includes functions to perform thresholding and tne resolution tuning according to methods in the literature as well as newly designed visual and statistical tools for assessing WaveD fits. We give a waved tutorial session and review benchmark examples of noisy convolutions to illustrate the non-linear adaptive properties of wavelet deconvolution.","Most empirical social scientists are surprised that low-level numerical issues in software can have deleterious effects on the estimation process. Statistical analyses that appear to be perfectly successful can be invalidated by concealed numerical problems. We have developed a set of tools, contained in accuracy, a package for R and S-PLUS, to diagnose problems stemming from numerical and measurement error and to improve the accuracy of inferences. The tools included in accuracy include a framework for gauging the computational stability of model results, tools for comparing model results, optimization diagnostics, and tools for collecting entropy for true random numbers generation.","ade4 is a multivariate data analysis package for the R statistical environment, and ade4TkGUI is a Tcl/Tk graphical user interface for the most essential methods of ade4. Both packages are available on CRAN. An overview of ade4TkGUI is presented, and the pros and cons of this approach are discussed. We conclude that command line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI) are complementary. ade4TkGUI can be valuable for biologists and particularly for ecologists who are often occasional users of R. It can spare them having to acquire an in-depth knowledge of R, and it can help first time users in a first approach.","The third special volume in the \"Foometrics in R\" series of the Journal of Statistical Software collects a number of contributions describing statistical methodology and corresponding implementations related to ecology and ecological modelling. The scope of the papers ranges from theoretical ecology and ecological modelling to statistical methodology relevant for data analyses in ecological applications.","Palaeoecology is an important branch of ecology that uses the subfossil remains of organisms preserved in lake, ocean and bog sediments to inform on changes in ecosystems and the environment through time. The analogue package contains functions to perform modern analogue technique (MAT) transfer functions, which can be used to predict past changes in the environment, such as climate or lake-water pH from species data. A related technique is that of analogue matching, which is concerned with identifying modern sites that are floristically and faunistically similar to fossil samples. These techniques, and others, are increasingly being used to inform public policy on environmental pollution and conservation practices. These methods and other functionality in analogue are illustrated using the Surface Waters Acidification Project diatom:pH training set and diatom counts on samples of a sediment core from the Round Loch of Glenhead, Galloway, Scotland.  The paper is aimed at palaeoecologists who are familiar with the techniques described but not with R.","This paper provides a brief introduction to the R package bio.infer, a set of scripts that facilitates the use of maximum likelihood (ML) methods for predicting environmental conditions from assemblage composition. Environmental conditions can often be inferred from only biological data, and these inferences are useful when other sources of data are unavailable. ML prediction methods are statistically rigorous and applicable to a broader set of problems than more commonly used weighted averaging techniques. However, ML methods require a substantially greater investment of time to program algorithms and to perform computations. This package is designed to reduce the effort required to apply ML prediction methods.","Multivariate analyses are well known and widely used to identify and understand structures of ecological communities. The ade4 package for the R statistical environment proposes a great number of multivariate methods. Its implementation follows the tradition of the French school of \"Analyse des Donnees\" and is based on the use of the duality diagram. We present the theory of the duality diagram and discuss its implementation in ade4. Classes and main functions are presented. An example is given to illustrate the ade4 philosophy.","Knowledge of the environmental features affecting habitat selection by animals is important for designing wildlife management and conservation policies. The package adehabitat for the R software is designed to provide a computing environment for the analysis and modelling of such relationships. This paper focuses on the preliminary steps of data exploration and analysis, performed prior to a more formal modelling of habitat selection.  In this context, I illustrate the use of a factorial analysis, the K-select analysis.  This method is a factorial decomposition of marginality, one measure of habitat selection.  This method was chosen to present the package because it illustrates clearly many of its features (home range estimation, spatial analyses, graphical possibilities, etc.). I strongly stress the powerful capabilities of factorial methods for data analysis, using as an example the analysis of habitat selection by the wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) in a Mediterranean environment.","Ecologists are concerned with the relationships between species composition and environmental framework incorporating space explicitly is an extremely flexible tool for answering these questions. The R package ecodist brings together methods for working with dissimilarities, including some not available in other R packages. We present some of the features of ecodist, particularly simple and partial Mantel tests, and make recommendations for their effective use. Although the partial Mantel test is often used to account for the effects of space, the assumption of linearity greatly reduces its effectiveness for complex spatial patterns. We introduce a modification of the Mantel correlogram designed to overcome this restriction and allow consideration of complex nonlinear structures. This extension of the method allows the use of partial multivariate correlograms and tests of relationship between variables at different spatial scales. Some of the possibilities are demonstrated using both artificial data and data from an ongoing study of plant community composition in grazinglands of the northeastern United States.","Results of ecological models differ, to some extent, more from measured data than from empirical knowledge. Existing techniques for validation based on quantitative assessments sometimes cause an underestimation of the performance of models due to time shifts, accelerations and delays or systematic differences between measurement and simulation.  However, for the application of such models it is often more important to reproduce essential patterns instead of seemingly exact numerical values.  This paper presents techniques to identify patterns and numerical methods to measure the consistency of patterns between observations and model results. An orthogonal set of deviance measures for absolute, relative and ordinal scale was compiled to provide informations about the type of difference. Furthermore, two different approaches accounting for time shifts were presented. The first one transforms the time to take time delays and speed differences into account. The second one describes known qualitative criteria dividing time series into interval units in accordance to their main features. The methods differ in their basic concepts and in the form of the resulting criteria. Both approaches and the deviance measures discussed are implemented in an R package. All methods are demonstrated by means of water quality measurements and simulation data.  The proposed quality criteria allow to recognize systematic differences and time shifts between time series and to conclude about the quantitative and qualitative similarity of patterns.","The simecol package provides an open structure to implement, simulate and share ecological models. A generalized object-oriented architecture improves readability and potential code re-use of models and makes simecol-models freely extendable and simple to use. The simecol package was implemented in the S4 class system of the programming language R. Reference applications, e.g. predator-prey models or grid models are provided which can be used as a starting point for own developments. Compact example applications and the complete code of an individual-based model of the water flea Daphnia document the efficient usage of simecol for various purposes in ecological modeling, e.g. scenario analysis, stochastic simulations and individual based population dynamics.  Ecologists are encouraged to exploit the abilities of simecol to structure their work and to use R and object-oriented programming as a suitable medium for the distribution and share of ecological modeling code.","The analysis of matrix population models has become a fundamental tool in ecology, conservation biology, and life history theory. In this paper, I present demogR, a package for analyzing age-structured population models in R. The package includes tools for the construction and analysis of matrix population models. In addition to the standard analyses commonly used in evolutionary demography and conservation biology, demogR contains a variety of tools from classical demography. This includes the construction of period life tables, and the generation of model mortality and fertility schedules for human populations. The tools in demogR are generally applicable to age-structured populations but are particularly useful for analyzing problems in human ecology. I illustrate some of the capabilities of the package by doing an evolutionary demographic analysis of several human populations.","A complete assessment of population growth and viability from field census data often requires complex data manipulations, statistical routines, mathematical tools, programming environments, and graphical capabilities. We therefore designed an R package called popbio to facilitate both the construction and analysis of projection matrix models. The package consists primarily of the R translation of MATLAB code found in Caswell (2001) and Morris and Doak (2002) for the analysis of projection matrix models. The package also includes methods to estimate vital rates and construct projection matrix models from census data typically collected in plant demography studies. In these studies, vital rates can often be estimated directly from annual censuses of tagged individuals using transition frequency tables. Because the construction of projection matrix models requires careful management of census data, we describe the steps to construct a projection matrix in detail.","The distribution of abundance amongst species with similar ways of life is a classical problem in ecology.  The unified neutral theory of biodiversity, due to Hubbell, states that observed population dynamics may be explained on the assumption of per capita equivalence amongst individuals.  One can thus dispense with differences between species, and differences between abundant and rare species: all individuals behave alike in respect of their probabilities of reproducing and death.  It is a striking fact that such a parsimonious theory results in a non-trivial dominancediversity curve (that is, the simultaneous existence of both abundant and rare species) and even more striking that the theory predicts abundance curves that match observations across a wide range of ecologies.  This paper introduces the untb package of R routines, for numerical simulation of ecological drift under the unified neutral theory. A range of visualization, analytical, and simulation tools are provided in the package and these are presented with examples in the paper.","Exact inference is based on the conditional distribution of the sufficient statistics for the parameters of interest given the observed values for the remaining sufficient statistics.  Exact inference for logistic regression can be problematic when data sets are large and the support of the conditional distribution cannot be represented in memory. Additionally, these methods are not widely implemented except in commercial software packages such as LogXact and SAS. Therefore, we have developed elrm, software for R implementing (approximate) exact inference for binomial regression models from large data sets. We provide a description of the underlying statistical methods and illustrate the use of elrm with examples. We also evaluate elrm by comparing results with those obtained using other methods.","Copulas have become a popular tool in multivariate modeling successfully applied in many fields. A good open-source implementation of copulas is much needed for more practitioners to enjoy the joy of copulas. This article presents the design, features, and some implementation details of the R package copula. The package provides a carefully designed and easily extensible platform for multivariate modeling with copulas in R. S4 classes for most frequently used elliptical copulas and Archimedean copulas are implemented, with methods for density/distribution evaluation, random number generation, and graphical display. Fitting copula-based models with maximum likelihood method is provided as template examples. With the classes and methods in the package, the package can be easily extended by user-defined copulas and margins to solve problems.","In this age of ever-increasing data set sizes, especially in the natural sciences, visualisation becomes more and more important. Self-organizing maps have many features that make them attractive in this respect: they do not rely on distributional assumptions, can handle huge data sets with ease, and have shown their worth in a large number of applications. In this paper, we highlight the kohonen package for R, which implements self-organizing maps as well as some extensions for supervised pattern recognition and data fusion.","A Fortran 95 program has been written to calculate critical values for the step-up and step-down FDR procedures developed by Somerville (2004). The program allows for arbitrary selection of number of hypotheses, FDR rate, one- or two-sided hypotheses, common correlation coefficient of the test statistics and degrees of freedom. An MCV (minimum critical value) may be specified, or the program will calculate a specified number of critical values or steps in an FDR procedure. The program can also be used to efficiently ascertain an upper bound to the number of hypotheses which the procedure will reject, given either the values of the test statistics, or their p values. Limiting the number of steps in an FDR procedure can be used to control the number or proportion of false discoveries (Somerville and Hemmelmann 2007). Using the program to calculate the largest critical values makes possible efficient use of the FDR procedures for very large numbers of hypotheses.","Kernel smoothing is one of the most widely used non-parametric data smoothing techniques.  We introduce a new R package ks for multivariate kernel smoothing. Currently it contains functionality for kernel density estimation and kernel discriminant analysis. It is a comprehensive package for bandwidth matrix selection, implementing a wide range of data-driven diagonal and unconstrained bandwidth selectors.","The software package BAMP provides a method of analyzing incidence or mortality data on the Lexis diagram, using a Bayesian version of an age-period-cohort model. A hierarchical model is assumed with a binomial model in the first-stage. As smoothing priors for the age, period and cohort parameters random walks of first and second order, with and without an additional unstructured component are available. Unstructured heterogeneity can also be included in the model.  In order to evaluate the model fit, posterior deviance, DIC and predictive deviances are computed. By projecting the random walk prior into the future, future death rates can be predicted.","This paper describes the use of GLDEX in R to fit distributions to empirical data using the discretized and maximum likelihood methods. The GLDEX package also provides diagnostic tests to examine the quality of fit through the resample Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test, quantile plots and comparison of the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis between the empirical data and the fitted distribution.","ROC analysis is a standard method for estimating and comparing diagnostic tests' accuracies when the gold standard is binary. However, there are many situations when the gold standard is not binary. In these situations, traditional ROC methods applied have lead to biased and uninformative outcomes. This article introduces nonbinROC, software for R that implements nonparametric estimators proposed by Obuchowski (2005) for estimating and comparing diagnostic tests' accuracies when the gold standard is measured on a continuous, ordinal or nominal scale. The results produced from these estimators are interpreted in the same manner as in ROC analysis but are not associated with any ROC curve.","Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most widely used method of estimating joint posterior distributions in Bayesian analysis.  The idea of MCMC is to iteratively produce parameter values that are representative samples from the joint posterior.  Unlike frequentist analysis where iterative model fitting routines are monitored for convergence to a single point, MCMC output is monitored for convergence to a distribution.  Thus, specialized diagnostic tools are needed in the Bayesian setting.  To this end, the R package boa was created.  This manuscript presents the user's manual for boa, which outlines the use of and methodology upon which the software is based.  Included is a description of the menu system, data management capabilities, and statistical/graphical methods for convergence assessment and posterior inference.  Throughout the manual, a linear regression example is used to illustrate the software.","This paper presents the reshape package for R, which provides a common framework for many types of data reshaping and aggregation. It uses a paradigm  of 'melting' and 'casting', where the data are 'melted' into a form which distinguishes measured and identifying variables, and then 'cast' into a new shape, whether it be a data frame, list, or high dimensional array.  The paper includes an introduction to the conceptual framework, practical advice for melting and casting, and a case study.","To simulate Gaussian fields poses serious numerical problems: storage and computing time. The midpoint displacement method is often used for simulating the fractional Brownian fields because it is fast.  We propose an effective and fast method, valid not only for fractional Brownian fields, but for any Gaussian fields. First, our method is compared with midpoint for fractional Brownian fields. Second, the performance of our method is illustrated by simulating several Gaussian fields. The software FieldSim is an R package developed in R and C and that implements the procedures on which this paper focuses.","The traveling salesperson (or, salesman) problem (TSP) is a well known and important combinatorial optimization problem. The goal is to find the shortest tour that visits each city in a given list exactly once and then returns to the starting city. Despite this simple problem statement, solving the TSP is difficult since it belongs to the class of NP-complete problems. The importance of the TSP arises besides from its theoretical appeal from the variety of its applications. Typical applications in operations research include vehicle routing, computer wiring, cutting wallpaper and job sequencing. The main application in statistics is combinatorial data analysis, e.g., reordering rows and columns of data matrices or identifying clusters. In this paper, we introduce the R package TSP which provides a basic infrastructure for handling and solving the traveling salesperson problem.  The package features S3 classes for specifying a TSP and its (possibly optimal) solution as well as several heuristics to find good solutions. In addition, it provides an interface to Concorde, one of the best exact TSP solvers currently available.","Barry and Hartigan (1993) propose a Bayesian analysis for change point problems.  We provide a brief summary of selected work on change point problems, both preceding and following Barry and Hartigan. We outline Barry and Hartigan's approach and offer a new R package, bcp (Erdman and Emerson 2007), implementing their analysis.  We discuss two frequentist alternatives to the Bayesian analysis, the recursive circular binary segmentation algorithm (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004) and the dynamic programming algorithm of (Bai and Perron 2003). We illustrate the application of bcp with economic and microarray data from the literature.","Many statistical analyses (e.g., in econometrics, biostatistics and experimental design) are based on models containing systems of structurally related equations.  The systemfit package provides the capability to estimate systems of linear equations within the R programming environment.  For instance, this package can be used for \"ordinary least squares\" (OLS),  \"seemingly unrelated regression\" (SUR), and the instrumental variable (IV) methods \"two-stage least squares\" (2SLS) and \"three-stage least squares\" (3SLS), where SUR and 3SLS estimations can optionally be iterated.  Furthermore, the systemfit package provides tools for several statistical tests.  It has been tested on a variety of datasets and its reliability is demonstrated.","Our ltsa package implements the Durbin-Levinson and Trench algorithms and provides a general approach to the problems of fitting, forecasting and simulating linear time series models as well as fitting regression models with linear time series errors.  For computational efficiency both algorithms are implemented in C and interfaced to R.  Examples are given which illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms.  We provide a second package FGN which illustrates the use of  the ltsa package with fractional Gaussian noise (FGN).  It is hoped that the ltsa will provide a base for further time series software.","In this paper we present the R package gRc for statistical inference in graphical Gaussian models in which symmetry restrictions have been imposed on the concentration or partial correlation matrix.  The models are represented by coloured graphs where parameters associated with edges or vertices of same colour are restricted to being identical.  We describe algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation and discuss model selection issues. The paper illustrates the practical use of the gRc package.","GAMLSS is a general framework for fitting regression type models where the distribution of the response variable does not have to belong to the exponential family and includes highly skew and kurtotic continuous and discrete distribution. GAMLSS allows all the parameters of the distribution of the response variable to be modelled as linear/non-linear or smooth functions of the explanatory variables. This  paper starts by defining the statistical framework of GAMLSS, then  describes the current implementation of GAMLSS in R and finally gives four different data examples to demonstrate how GAMLSS can be used for statistical modelling.","A preliminary attempt at collecting tools and utilities for genetic data as an R package called gap is described. Genomewide association is then described as a specific example, linking the work of Risch and Merikangas (1996), Long and Langley (1997) for family-based and population-based studies, and the counterpart for case-cohort design established by Cai and Zeng (2004).  Analysis of staged design as outlined by Skol et al. (2006) and associate methods are discussed. The package is flexible, customizable, and should  prove useful to researchers especially in its application to genomewide association studies.","This is a macro which facilitates remote execution of WinBUGS from within SAS.  The macro pre-processes data for WinBUGS, writes the WinBUGS batch-script, executes this script and reads in output statistics from the WinBUGS log-file back into SAS native format. The user specifies the input and output file names and directory path as well as the statistics to be monitored in WinBUGS.  The code works best for a model that has already been set up and checked for convergence diagnostics within WinBUGS.  An obvious extension of the use of this macro is for running simulations where the input and output files all have the same name but all that differs between simulation iterations is the input dataset. The functionality and syntax of the macro call are described in this paper and illustrated using a simple linear regression model.","This article introduces yaImpute, an R package for nearest neighbor search and imputation.  Although nearest neighbor imputation is used in a host of disciplines, the methods implemented in the yaImpute package are tailored to imputation-based forest attribute estimation and mapping.  The impetus to writing the yaImpute is a growing interest in nearest neighbor imputation methods for spatially explicit forest inventory, and a need within this research community for software that facilitates comparison among different nearest neighbor search algorithms and subsequent imputation techniques. yaImpute provides directives for defining the search space, subsequent distance calculation, and imputation rules for a given number of nearest neighbors.  Further, the package offers a suite of diagnostics for comparison among results generated from different imputation analyses and a set of functions for mapping imputation results.","The PresenceAbsence package for R provides a set of functions useful when evaluating the results of presence-absence analysis, for example, models of species distribution or the analysis of diagnostic tests. The package provides a toolkit for selecting the optimal threshold for translating a probability surface into presence-absence maps specifically tailored to their intended use. The package includes functions for calculating threshold dependent measures such as confusion matrices, percent correctly classified (PCC), sensitivity, specificity, and Kappa, and produces plots of each measure as the threshold is varied. It also includes functions to plot the Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculates the associated area under the curve (AUC), a threshold independent measure of model quality. Finally, the package computes optimal thresholds by multiple criteria, and plots these optimized thresholds on the graphs.","Canonical correlations analysis (CCA) is an exploratory statistical method to highlight correlations between two data sets acquired on the same experimental units. The cancor() function in R (R Development Core Team 2007) performs the core of computations but further work was required to provide the user with additional tools to facilitate the interpretation of the results. We implemented an R package, CCA, freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN, http://CRAN.R-project.org/), to develop numerical and graphical outputs and to enable the user to handle missing values. The CCA package also includes a regularized version of CCA to deal with data sets with more variables than units. Illustrations are given through the analysis of a data set coming from a nutrigenomic study in the mouse.","In this article, we present FactoMineR an R package dedicated to multivariate data analysis. The main features of this package is the possibility to take into account different types of variables (quantitative or categorical), different types of structure on the data (a partition on the variables, a hierarchy on the variables, a partition on the individuals) and finally supplementary information (supplementary individuals and variables). Moreover, the dimensions issued from the different exploratory data analyses can be automatically described by quantitative and/or categorical variables. Numerous graphics are also available with various options. Finally, a graphical user interface is implemented within the Rcmdr environment in order to propose an user friendly package.","The MLDS package  in the R programming language can be used to estimate perceptual scales based on the results of psychophysical experiments using the method of difference scaling. In a difference scaling experiment, observers compare two supra-threshold differences (a,b) and (c,d) on each trial.  The approach is based on a stochastic model of how the observer decides which perceptual difference (or interval) (a,b) or (c,d) is greater, and the parameters of the model are estimated using a maximum likelihood criterion.  We also propose a method  to test the model by evaluating the self-consistency of the estimated scale.  The package includes an example in which an observer judges the differences in correlation between scatterplots. The example may be readily adapted to estimate perceptual scales for arbitrary physical continua.","Seriation, i.e., finding a suitable linear order for a set of objects given data and a loss or merit function, is a basic problem in data analysis.  Caused by the problem's combinatorial nature, it is hard to solve for all but very small sets.  Nevertheless, both exact solution methods and heuristics are available.  In this paper we present the package seriation which provides an infrastructure for seriation with R.  The infrastructure comprises data structures to represent linear orders as permutation vectors, a wide array of seriation methods using a consistent interface, a method to calculate the value of various loss and merit functions, and several visualization techniques which build on seriation. To illustrate how easily the package can be applied for a variety of applications, a comprehensive collection of examples is presented.","The R package clValid contains functions for validating the results of a clustering analysis.  There are three main types of cluster validation measures available, \"internal\", \"stability\", and \"biological\".  The user can choose from nine clustering algorithms in existing R packages, including hierarchical, K-means, self-organizing maps (SOM), and model-based clustering.  In addition, we provide a function to perform the self-organizing tree algorithm (SOTA) method of clustering.  Any combination of validation measures and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call.  This allows the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering algorithms while varying the number of clusters, to help determine the most appropriate method and number of clusters for the dataset of interest.  Additionally, the package can automatically make use of the biological information contained in the Gene Ontology (GO) database to calculate the biological validation measures, via the annotation packages available in Bioconductor. The function returns an object of S4 class \"clValid\", which has summary, plot, print, and additional methods which allow the user to display the optimal validation scores and extract clustering results.","During the last decade text mining has become a widely used   discipline utilizing statistical and machine learning methods. We  present the tm package which provides a framework for text mining  applications within R. We give a survey on text mining facilities in R and explain how typical application tasks can be carried out using our framework. We present techniques for count-based analysis methods, text clustering, text classification and string kernels.","Genetic algorithms (GAs) are a popular technology to search for an optimum in a large search space. Using new concepts of forbidden array and weighted mutation, Mandal, Wu, and Johnson (2006) used elements of GAs to introduce a new global optimization technique called sequential elimination of level combinations (SELC), that efficiently finds optimums.  A SAS macro, and MATLAB and R functions are developed to implement the SELC algorithm.","actuar is a package providing additional Actuarial Science functionality to the R statistical system. The project was launched in 2005 and the package is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network since February 2006.  The current version of the package contains functions for use in the fields of loss distributions modeling, risk theory (including ruin theory), simulation of compound hierarchical models and credibility theory. This paper presents in detail but with few technical terms the most recent version of the package.","Modeling the interaction between persons and items at the item level for binary response data, item response theory (IRT) models have been found useful in a wide variety of applications in various fields. This paper provides the requisite information and description of software that implements the Gibbs sampling procedures for the one-, two- and three-parameter normal ogive models. The software developed is written in the MATLAB package IRTuno. The package is flexible enough to allow a user the choice to simulate binary response data, set the number of total or burn-in iterations, specify starting values or prior distributions for model parameters, check convergence of the Markov chain, and obtain Bayesian fit statistics. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate and validate the use of the software package. The m-file v25i08.m is also provided as a guide for the user of the MCMC algorithms with the three dichotomous IRT models.","The datasets being produced by high-throughput biological experiments, such as microarrays, have forced biologists to turn to sophisticated statistical analysis and visualization tools in order to understand their data. We address the particular need for an open-source exploratory data analysis tool that applies numerical methods in coordination with interactive graphics to the analysis of experimental data.  The software package, known as explorase, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) on top of the R platform for statistical computing and the GGobi software for multivariate interactive graphics. The GUI is designed for use by biologists, many of whom are unfamiliar with the R language. It displays metadata about experimental design and biological entities in tables that are sortable and filterable. There are menu shortcuts to the analysis methods implemented in R, including graphical interfaces to linear modeling tools.  The GUI is linked to data plots in GGobi through a brush tool that simultaneously colors rows in the entity information table and points in the GGobi plots.","This article illustrates usage of the ramps R package, which implements the reparameterized and marginalized posterior sampling (RAMPS) algorithm for complex Bayesian geostatistical models.  The RAMPS methodology allows joint modeling of areal and point-source data arising from the same underlying spatial process.  A reparametrization of variance parameters facilitates slice sampling based on simplexes, which can be useful in general when multiple variances are present.  Prediction at arbitrary points can be made, which is critical in applications where maps are needed.  Our implementation takes advantage of sparse matrix operations  in the Matrix package and can provide substantial savings in computing time for large datasets.  A user-friendly interface, similar to the nlme mixed effects models package, enables users to analyze datasets with little programming effort.  Support is provided for numerous spatial and spatiotemporal correlation structures, user-defined correlation structures, and non-spatial random effects.  The package features are illustrated via a synthetic dataset of spatially correlated observation distributed across the state of Iowa, USA.","Data matching is a typical statistical problem in non experimental and/or observational studies or, more generally, in cross-sectional studies in which one or more data sets are to be compared. Several methods are available in the literature, most of  which based on a particular metric or on statistical models, either parametric or nonparametric. In this paper we present two methods to calculate a proximity which have the property of being invariant under monotonic transformations. These methods require at most the notion of ordering. An open-source software in the form of a R package is also presented.","The deterministic dynamics of populations in continuous time are traditionally described using coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations. While this approach is accurate for large systems, it is often inadequate for small systems where key species may be present in small numbers or where key reactions occur at a low rate. The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is a procedure for generating time-evolution trajectories of finite populations in continuous time and has become the standard algorithm for these types of stochastic models. This article presents a simple-to-use and flexible framework for implementing the SSA using the high-level statistical computing language R and the package GillespieSSA. Using three ecological models as examples (logistic growth, Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and Kermack-McKendrick SIRS metapopulation model), this paper shows how a deterministic model can be formulated as a finite-population stochastic model within the framework of SSA theory and how it can be implemented in R. Simulations of the stochastic models are performed using four different SSA Monte Carlo methods: one exact method (Gillespie's direct method); and three approximate methods (explicit, binomial, and optimized tau-leap methods). Comparison of simulation results confirms that while the time-evolution trajectories obtained from the different SSA methods are indistinguishable, the approximate methods are up to four orders of magnitude faster than the exact methods.","Many techniques have been proposed for judging the significance of effects in unreplicated 2k and 2k-p designs. However, relatively few methods have been proposed for analyzing unreplicated designs with possible outliers. Outliers can be a major impediment to valid interpretation of data from unreplicated designs. This paper presents SAS macros which automate a manual method for detecting an outlier and performing an analysis of data from an unreplicated 2k or 2k-p design when an outlier is present. This method was originally suggested by Cuthbert Daniel and is based on the normal or half normal plot of effects. This automated version was shown in simulation studies to perform better than other procedures proposed to do the same thing.","The GEEQBOX toolbox analyzes correlated data via the method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) and quasi-least squares (QLS), an approach based on GEE that overcomes some limitations of GEE that have been noted in the literature. GEEQBOX is currently able to handle correlated data that follows a normal, Bernoulli or Poisson distribution, and that is assumed to have an AR(1), Markov, tri-diagonal, equicorrelated, unstructured or working independence correlation structure. This toolbox is for use with MATLAB.","statnet is a suite of software packages for statistical network analysis. The packages implement recent advances in network modeling based on exponential-family random graph models (ERGM). The components of the package provide a comprehensive framework for ERGM-based network modeling, including tools for model estimation, model evaluation, model-based network simulation, and network visualization. This broad functionality is powered by a central Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The coding is optimized for speed and robustness.","Effective memory structures for relational data within R must be capable of representing a wide range of data while keeping overhead to a minimum.  The network package provides an class which may be used for encoding complex relational structures composed a vertex set together with any combination of undirected/directed, valued/unvalued, dyadic/hyper, and single/multiple edges; storage requirements are on the order of the number of edges involved.  Some simple constructor, interface, and visualization functions are provided, as well as a set of operators to facilitate employment by end users.  The package also supports a C-language API, which allows developers to work directly with network objects within backend code.","We describe some of the capabilities of the ergm package and the statistical theory underlying it.  This package contains tools for accomplishing three important, and inter-related, tasks involving exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs):  estimation, simulation, and goodness of fit.  More precisely, ergm has the capability of approximating a maximum likelihood estimator for an ERGM given a network data set; simulating new network data sets from a fitted ERGM using Markov chain Monte Carlo; and assessing how well a fitted ERGM does at capturing characteristics of a particular network data set.","Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) represent the processes that govern the formation of links in networks through the terms selected by the user. The terms specify network statistics that are sufficient to represent the probability distribution over the space of networks of that size. Many classes of statistics can be used.  In this article we describe the classes of statistics that are currently available in the ergm package. We also describe means for controlling the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that the package uses for estimation. These controls affect either the proposal distribution on the sample space used by the underlying Metropolis-Hastings algorithm or the constraints on the sample space itself. Finally, we describe various other arguments to core functions of the ergm package.","latentnet is a package to fit and evaluate statistical latent position and cluster models for networks. Hoff, Raftery, and Handcock (2002) suggested an approach to modeling networks based on positing the existence of an latent space of characteristics of the actors. Relationships form as a function of distances between these characteristics as well as functions of observed dyadic level covariates. In latentnet social distances are represented in a Euclidean space. It also includes a variant of the extension of the latent position model to allow for clustering of the positions developed in Handcock, Raftery, and Tantrum (2007).  The package implements Bayesian inference for the models based on an Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. It can also compute maximum likelihood estimates for the latent position model and a two-stage maximum likelihood method for the latent position cluster model. For latent position cluster models, the package provides a Bayesian way of assessing how many groups there are, and thus whether or not there is any clustering (since if the preferred number of groups is 1, there is little evidence for clustering). It also estimates which cluster each actor belongs to. These estimates are probabilistic, and provide the probability of each actor belonging to each cluster. It computes four types of point estimates for the coefficients and positions: maximum likelihood estimate, posterior mean, posterior mode and the estimator which minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence from the posterior. You can assess the goodness-of-fit of the model via posterior predictive checks. It has a function to simulate networks from a latent position or latent position cluster model.","Modern social network analysis---the analysis of relational data arising from social systems---is a computationally intensive area of research.  Here, we provide an overview of a software package which provides support for a range of network analytic functionality within the R statistical computing environment.  General categories of currently supported functionality are described, and brief examples of package syntax and usage are shown.","Work with longitudinal network survey data and the dynamic network outputs of the statnet ERGMs has demonstrated the need for consistent frameworks and data structures for expressing, storing, and manipulating information about networks that change in time.  Motivated by our requirements for exchanging data among researchers and various analysis and visualization processes, we have created an R package dynamicnetwork that builds upon previous work in the network, statnet and sna packages and provides a limited functional implementation.  This paper discusses design issues and considerations, describes classes and forms of dynamic data, and works through several examples to demonstrate the utility of the package. The functionality of the rSoNIA package that uses dynamicnetwork to exchange data with the Social Network Image Animator (SoNIA) software to create animated movies of changing networks from within R is also demonstrated.","The ability to simulate graphs with given properties is important for the analysis of social networks.  Sequential importance sampling has been shown to be particularly effective in estimating the number of graphs adhering to fixed marginals and in estimating the null distribution of graph statistics.  This paper describes the networksis package for R and how its simulate and simulate_sis functions can be used to address both of these tasks as well as generate initial graphs for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations","The statnet suite of R packages contains a wide range of functionality for the statistical analysis of social networks, including the implementation of exponential-family random graph (ERG) models.  In this paper we illustrate some of the functionality of statnet through a tutorial analysis of a friendship network of 1,461 adolescents.","BARS  (DiMatteo, Genovese, and Kass 2001) uses the powerful reversible-jump MCMC engine to perform spline-based generalized nonparametric regression.  It has been shown to work well in terms of having small mean-squared error in many examples (smaller than known competitors),  as well as producing visually-appealing fits that are smooth (filtering out high-frequency noise) while adapting to sudden changes (retaining high-frequency signal). However, BARS is computationally intensive. The original implementation in S was too slow to be practical in certain situations, and was found to handle some data sets incorrectly.  We have implemented BARS in C for the normal and Poisson cases, the latter being important in neurophysiological and other point-process applications. The C implementation includes all needed subroutines for fitting Poisson regression, manipulating B-splines (using code created by Bates and Venables), and finding starting values for Poisson regression (using code for density estimation created by Kooperberg). The code utilizes only  freely-available external libraries (LAPACK and BLAS)  and is otherwise self-contained.  We have also provided wrappers so that  BARS can be used easily within S or R.","One of the most widely used goodness-of-fit tests is the two-sided one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test which has been implemented by many computer statistical software packages.  To calculate a two-sided p value (evaluate the cumulative sampling distribution), these packages use various methods including recursion formulae, limiting distributions, and approximations of unknown accuracy developed over thirty years ago.  Based on an extensive literature search for the two-sided one sample K-S test, this paper identifies an exact formula for sample sizes up to 31, six recursion formulae, and one matrix formula that can be used to calculate a p value.  To ensure accurate calculation by avoiding catastrophic cancelation and eliminating rounding error, each of these formulae is implemented in rational arithmetic.  For the six recursion formulae and the matrix formula, computational experience for sample sizes up to 500 shows that computational times are increasing functions of both the sample size and the number of digits in the numerator and denominator integers of the rational number test statistic.  The computational times of the seven formulae vary immensely but the Durbin recursion formula is almost always the fastest.  Linear search is used to calculate the inverse of the cumulative sampling distribution (find the confidence interval half-width) and tables of calculated half-widths are presented for sample sizes up to 500.  Using calculated half-widths as input, computational times for the fastest formula, the Durbin recursion formula, are given for sample sizes up to two thousand.","Efficient rational arithmetic methods that can exactly evaluate the cumulative sampling distribution of the one-sided one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test have been developed by Brown and Harvey (2007) for sample sizes n up to fifty thousand. This paper implements in arbitrary precision the same 13 formulae to evaluate the one-sided one sample K-S cumulative sampling distribution. Computational experience identifies the fastest implementation which is then used to calculate confidence interval bandwidths and p values for sample sizes up to ten million.","The inverse Gaussian distribution is a positively skewed probability model that has received great attention in the last 20 years. Recently, a family that generalizes this model called inverse Gaussian type distributions has been developed. The new R package named ig has been designed to analyze data from inverse Gaussian type distributions. This package contains basic probabilistic functions, lifetime indicators and a random number generator from this model. Also, parameter estimates and diagnostics analysis can be obtained using likelihood methods by means of this package. In addition, goodness-of-fit methods are implemented in order to detect the suitability of the model to the data. The capabilities and features of the ig package are illustrated using simulated and real data sets. Furthermore, some new results related to the inverse Gaussian type distribution are also obtained. Moreover, a simulation study is conducted for evaluating the estimation method implemented in the ig package.","Model averaging has been shown to be a useful method for incorporating model uncertainty in quantitative risk estimation. In certain circumstances this technique is computationally complex, requiring sophisticated software to carry out the computation. We introduce software that implements model averaging for risk assessment based upon dichotomous dose-response data. This software, which we call Model Averaging for Dichotomous Response Benchmark Dose (MADr-BMD), fits the quantal response models, which are also used in the US Environmental Protection Agency benchmark dose software suite, and generates a model-averaged dose response model to generate benchmark dose and benchmark dose lower bound estimates. The software fulfills a need for risk assessors, allowing them to go beyond one single model in their risk assessments based on quantal data by focusing on a set of models that describes the experimental data.","Manufacturers and government agencies frequently use acceptance sampling to decide whether a lot from a supplier or exporting country should be accepted or rejected.  International standards on acceptance sampling provide sampling plans for specific circumstances.\n\nThe aim of this package is to provide an easy-to-use interface to visualize single, double or multiple sampling plans.  In addition, methods have been provided to enable the user to assess sampling plans against pre-specified levels of performance, as measured by the probability of acceptance for a given level of quality in the lot.","We present the cacher package for R, which provides tools for caching statistical analyses and for distributing these analyses to others in an efficient manner.  The cacher package takes objects created by evaluating R expressions and stores them in key-value databases.  These databases of cached objects can subsequently be assembled into packages for distribution over the web.  The cacher package also provides tools to help readers examine the data and code in a statistical analysis and reproduce, modify, or improve upon the results.  In addition, readers can easily conduct alternate analyses of the data.  We describe the design and implementation of the cacher package and provide two examples of how the package can be used for reproducible research.","Recently, computational methods and software have been receiving more attention in the econometrics literature, emphasizing that they are integral components of modern econometric research.  This has also promoted the development of many new econometrics software packages written in R and made available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This special volume on \"Econometrics in R\" features a selection of these recent activities that includes packages for econometric analysis of cross-section, time series and panel data. This introduction to the special volume highlights the contents of the contributions and embeds them into a brief overview of other past, present, and future projects for econometrics in R.","Panel data econometrics is obviously one of the main fields in the profession, but most of the models used are difficult to estimate with R. plm is a package for R which intends to make the estimation of linear panel models straightforward. plm provides functions to estimate a wide variety of models and to make (robust) inference.","Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are often needed in business and other contexts. We describe two automatic forecasting algorithms that have been implemented in the forecast package for R. The first is based on innovations state space models that underly exponential smoothing methods. The second is a step-wise algorithm for forecasting with ARIMA models. The algorithms are applicable to both seasonal and non-seasonal data, and are compared and illustrated using four real time series. We also briefly describe some of the other functionality available in the forecast package.","The structure of the package vars and its implementation of vector autoregressive, structural vector autoregressive and structural vector error correction models are explained in this paper. In addition to the three cornerstone functions VAR(), SVAR() and SVEC() for estimating such models, functions for diagnostic testing, estimation of a restricted models, prediction, causality analysis, impulse response analysis and forecast error variance decomposition are provided too. It is further possible to convert vector error correction models into their level VAR representation. The different methods and functions are elucidated by employing a macroeconomic data set for Canada. However, the focus in this writing is on the implementation part rather than the usage of the tools at hand.","We describe the R np package via a series of applications that may be of interest to applied econometricians. The np package implements a variety of nonparametric and semiparametric kernel-based estimators that are popular among econometricians. There are also procedures for nonparametric tests of significance and consistent model specification tests for parametric mean regression models and parametric quantile regression models, among others. The np package focuses on kernel methods appropriate for the mix of continuous, discrete, and categorical data often found in applied settings. Data-driven methods of bandwidth selection are emphasized throughout, though we caution the user that data-driven bandwidth selection methods can be computationally demanding.","Quantile regression for censored survival (duration) data offers a more flexible alternative to the Cox proportional hazard model for some applications. We describe three estimation methods for such applications that have been recently incorporated into the R package quantreg: the Powell (1986) estimator for fixed censoring, and two methods for random censoring, one introduced by Portnoy (2003), and the other by Peng and Huang (2008). The Portnoy and Peng-Huang estimators can be viewed, respectively, as generalizations to regression of the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimators of univariate quantiles for censored observations. Some asymptotic and simulation comparisons are made to highlight advantages and disadvantages of the three methods.","This paper describes the implementation of Heckman-type sample selection models in R. We discuss the sample selection problem as well as the Heckman solution to it, and argue that although modern econometrics has non- and semiparametric estimation methods in its toolbox, Heckman models are an integral part of the modern applied analysis and econometrics syllabus. We describe the implementation of these models in the package sampleSelection and illustrate the usage of the package on several simulation and real data examples. Our examples demonstrate the effect of exclusion restrictions, identification at infinity and misspecification. We argue that the package can be used both in applied research and teaching.","The classical Poisson, geometric and negative binomial regression models for count data belong to the family of generalized linear models and are available at the core of the statistics toolbox in the R system for statistical computing. After reviewing the conceptual and computational features of these methods, a new implementation of hurdle and zero-inflated regression models in the functions hurdle() and zeroinfl() from the package pscl is introduced. It re-uses design and functionality of the basic R functions just as the underlying conceptual tools extend the classical models. Both hurdle and zero-inflated model, are able to incorporate over-dispersion and excess zeros-two problems that typically occur in count data sets in economics and the social sciences-better than their classical counterparts. Using cross-section data on the demand for medical care, it is illustrated how the classical as well as the zero-augmented models can be fitted, inspected and tested in practice.","This paper presents R utilities for computing and displaying isosurfaces, or three-dimensional contour surfaces, from a three-dimensional array of function values.  A version of the marching cubes algorithm that takes into account face and internal ambiguities is used to compute the isosurfaces. Vectorization is used to ensure adequate performance using only R code.  Examples are presented showing contours of theoretical densities, density estimates, and medical imaging data.  Rendering can use the rgl package or standard or grid graphics, and a set of tools for representing and rendering surfaces using standard or grid graphics is presented.","The FitAR R (R Development Core Team 2008) package that is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network is described.  This package provides a comprehensive approach to fitting autoregressive and subset autoregressive time series.  For long time series with complicated autocorrelation behavior, such as the monthly sunspot numbers, subset autoregression may prove more feasible and/or parsimonious than using AR or ARMA models.  The two principal functions in this package are SelectModel and FitAR for automatic model selection and model fitting respectively.  In addition to the regular autoregressive model and the usual subset autoregressive models (Tong 1977), these functions implement a new family of models.  This new family of subset autoregressive models is obtained by using the partial autocorrelations as parameters and then selecting a subset of these parameters.  Further properties and results for these models are discussed in McLeod and Zhang (2006).  The advantages of this approach are that not only is an efficient algorithm for exact maximum likelihood implemented but that efficient methods are derived for selecting high-order subset models that may occur in massive datasets containing long time series. A new improved extended {BIC} criterion, {UBIC}, developed by Chen and Chen (2008) is implemented for subset model selection. A complete suite of model building functions for each of the three types of autoregressive models described above are included in the package. The package includes functions for time series plots, diagnostic testing and plotting, bootstrapping, simulation, forecasting, Box-Cox analysis, spectral density estimation and other useful time series procedures. As well as methods for standard generic functions including print, plot, predict and others, some new generic functions and methods are supplied that make it easier to work with the output from FitAR for bootstrapping, simulation, spectral density estimation and Box-Cox analysis.","We present a new R software package lawstat that contains statistical tests and procedures that are utilized in various litigations on securities law, antitrust law, equal employment and discrimination as well as in public policy and biostatistics. Along with the well known tests such as the Bartels test, runs test, tests of homogeneity of several sample proportions, the Brunner-Munzel tests, the Lorenz curve, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and others, the package contains new distribution-free robust tests for symmetry, robust tests for normality that are more sensitive to heavy-tailed departures, measures of relative variability, Levene-type tests against trends in variances etc. All implemented tests and methods are illustrated by simulations and real-life examples from legal cases, economics and biostatistics. Although the package is called lawstat, it presents implementation and discussion of statistical procedures and tests that are also employed in a variety of other applications, e.g., biostatistics, environmental studies, social sciences and others, in other words, all applications utilizing statistical data analysis. Hence, name of the package should not be considered as a restriction to legal statistics. The package will be useful to applied statisticians and \"quantitatively alert practitioners\" of other subjects as well as an asset in teaching statistical courses.","flexmix provides infrastructure for flexible fitting of finite mixture models in R using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or one of its variants. The functionality of the package was enhanced. Now concomitant variable models as well as varying and constant parameters for the component specific generalized linear regression models can be fitted.  The application of the package is demonstrated on several examples, the implementation described and examples given to illustrate how new drivers for the component specific models and the concomitant variable models can be defined.","The caret package, short for classification and regression training, contains numerous tools for developing predictive models using the rich set of models available in R. The package focuses on simplifying model training and tuning across a wide variety of modeling techniques. It also includes methods for pre-processing training data, calculating variable importance, and model visualizations. An example from computational chemistry is used to illustrate the functionality on a real data set and to benchmark the benefits of parallel processing with several types of models.","Invariant coordinate selection (ICS) has recently been introduced as a method for exploring multivariate data. It includes as a special case a method for recovering the unmixing matrix in independent components analysis (ICA). It also serves as a basis for classes of multivariate nonparametric tests, and as a tool in cluster analysis  or blind discrimination. The aim of this paper is to briefly explain the (ICS) method and to illustrate how various applications can be implemented using the R package ICS. Several examples are used to show how the ICS method and ICS package can be used in analyzing a multivariate data set.","Internal pilot designs involve conducting interim power analysis (without interim data analysis) to modify the final sample size.  Recently developed techniques have been described to avoid the type~I error rate inflation inherent to unadjusted hypothesis tests, while still providing the advantages of an internal pilot design.  We present GLUMIP 2.0, the latest version of our free SAS/IML software for planning internal pilot studies in the general linear univariate model (GLUM) framework.  The new analytic forms incorporated into the updated software solve many problems inherent to current internal pilot techniques for linear models with Gaussian errors. Hence, the GLUMIP 2.0 software makes it easy to perform exact power analysis for internal pilots under the GLUM framework with independent Gaussian errors and fixed predictors.","The R package coin implements a unified approach to permutation tests providing a huge class of independence tests for nominal, ordered, numeric, and censored data as well as multivariate data at mixed scales. Based on a rich and flexible conceptual framework that embeds different permutation test procedures into a common theory, a computational framework is established in coin that likewise embeds the corresponding R functionality in a common S4 class structure with associated generic functions. As a consequence, the computational tools in coin inherit the flexibility of the underlying theory and conditional inference functions for important special cases can be set up easily.  Conditional versions of classical tests---such as tests for location and scale problems in two or more samples, independence in two- or three-way contingency tables, or association problems for censored, ordered categorical or multivariate data---can  easily be implemented as special cases using this computational  toolbox by choosing appropriate transformations of the observations. The paper gives a detailed exposition of both the internal structure of the package and the provided user interfaces along with examples on how to extend the implemented functionality.","When dealing with high dimensional and low sample size data, feature selection is often needed to help reduce the dimension of the variable space while optimizing the classification task. Few tools exist for selecting variables in such data sets, especially when classes are numerous (>2).  We have developed ofw, an R package that implements, in the context of classification, the meta algorithm \"optimal feature weighting\". We focus on microarray data, although the method can be applied to any p >> n problems with continuous variables. The aim is to select relevant variables and to numerically evaluate the resulting variable selection. Two versions are proposed with the application of supervised multiclass classifiers such as classification and regression trees and support vector machines. Furthermore, a weighted approach can be chosen to deal with unbalanced multiclasses, a common characteristic in microarray data sets.","Unidimensional item response theory (IRT) models are useful when each item is designed to measure some facet of a unified  latent trait. In practical applications, items are not necessarily measuring the same underlying trait, and hence the more general multi-unidimensional model should be considered. This paper provides the requisite information and description of software that implements the Gibbs sampler for such models with two item parameters and a normal ogive form. The software developed is written in the MATLAB package IRTmu2no. The package is flexible enough to allow a user the choice to simulate binary response data with multiple dimensions, set the number of total or burn-in iterations, specify starting values or prior distributions for model parameters, check convergence of the Markov chain, as well as obtain Bayesian fit statistics. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate and validate the use of the software package.","Fisher's exact test, named for Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, tests contingency tables for homogeneity of proportion.  This paper discusses a generalization of Fisher's exact test for the case where some of the table entries are constrained to be zero.  The resulting test is useful for assessing cases where the null hypothesis of conditional multinomial distribution is suspected to be false.  The test is implemented in the form of a new R package, aylmer.","Gene expression data can be associated with various clinical outcomes. In particular, these data can be of importance in discovering survival-associated genes for medical applications.  As alternatives to traditional statistical methods, sophisticated methods and software programs have been developed to overcome the high-dimensional difficulty of microarray data.  Nevertheless, new algorithms and software programs are needed to include practical functions such as the discovery of multiple sets of survival-associated genes and the incorporation of risk factors, and to use in the R environment which many statisticians are familiar with.  For survival modeling with microarray data, we have developed a software program (called rbsurv) which can be used conveniently and interactively in the R environment. This program selects survival-associated genes based on the partial likelihood of the Cox model and separates training and validation sets of samples for robustness.  It can discover multiple sets of genes by iterative forward selection rather than one large set of genes. It can also allow adjustment for risk factors in microarray survival modeling. This software package, the rbsurv package, can be used to discover survival-associated genes with microarray data conveniently.","In this article we introduce the R package LogConcDEAD (Log-concave density estimation in arbitrary dimensions).  Its main function is to compute the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of a log-concave density.  Functions for plotting, sampling from the density estimate and evaluating the density estimate are provided.  All of the functions available in the package are illustrated using simple, reproducible examples with simulated data.","This paper presents the R package AdMit which provides flexible functions to approximate a certain target distribution and to efficiently generate a sample of random draws from it, given only a kernel of the target density function. The core algorithm consists of the function AdMit which fits an adaptive mixture of Student-t distributions to the density of interest. Then, importance sampling or the independence chain Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to obtain quantities of interest for the target density, using the fitted mixture as the importance or candidate density. The estimation procedure is fully automatic and thus avoids the time-consuming and difficult task of tuning a sampling algorithm. The relevance of the package is shown in two examples. The first aims at illustrating in detail the use of the functions provided by the package in a bivariate bimodal distribution. The second shows the relevance of the adaptive mixture procedure through the Bayesian estimation of a mixture of ARCH model fitted to foreign exchange log-returns data. The methodology is compared to standard cases of importance sampling and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using a naive candidate and with the Griddy-Gibbs approach.","RinRuby is a Ruby library that integrates the R interpreter in Ruby, making R's statistical routines and graphics available within Ruby. The library consists of a single Ruby script that is simple to install and does not require any special compilation or installation of R.  Since the library is 100% pure Ruby, it works on a variety of operating systems, Ruby implementations, and versions of R.  RinRuby's methods are simple, making for readable code.  This paper describes RinRuby usage, provides comprehensive documentation, gives several examples, and discusses RinRuby's implementation.  The latest version of RinRuby can be found at the project website: http://rinruby.ddahl.org/.","The maximum entropy bootstrap is an algorithm that creates an ensemble for time series inference. Stationarity is not required and the ensemble satisfies the ergodic theorem and the central limit theorem. The meboot R package implements such algorithm. This document introduces the procedure and illustrates its scope by means of several guided applications.","Propensity score analysis is a technique for adjusting for selection bias in observational data.  Estimated propensity scores (probability of treatment given observed covariates) are used for stratification of observations.  Within strata covariates should be more balanced between the two treatments than without the stratification.  PSAgraphics is an R package that provides flexible graphical tools to assess within strata balance between treatment groups, as well as how covariate distributions differ across strata.  Additional graphical tools facilitate estimation of treatment effects having adjusted for covariate differences.  Several new and conventional numerical measures of balance are also provided.","In this article the MCPMod package for the R programming environment will be introduced. It implements a recently developed methodology for the design and analysis of dose-response studies that combines aspects of multiple comparison procedures and modeling approaches (Bretz et al. 2005). The MCPMod package provides tools for the analysis of dose finding trials, as well as a variety of tools necessary to plan an experiment to be analyzed using the MCP-Mod methodology.","mefa is an R package for multivariate data handling in ecology and biogeography. It provides object classes to represent the data coded by samples, taxa and segments (i.e., subpopulations, repeated measures). It supports easy processing of the data along with relational data tables for samples and taxa. An object of class mefa is a project specific compendium of the dataset and can be easily used in further analyses. Methods are provided for extraction, aggregation, conversion, plotting, summary and reporting of mefa objects. Reports can be generated in plain text or LaTex. This paper presents worked examples on a variety of ecological analyses.","In this paper we describe MIDAS: a SAS macro for multiple imputation using distance aided selection of donors which implements an iterative predictive mean matching hot-deck for imputing missing data. This is a flexible multiple imputation approach that can handle data in a variety of formats: continuous, ordinal, and scaled. Because the imputation models are implicit, it is not necessary to specify a parametric distribution for each variable to be imputed.  MIDAS also allows the user to address the sensitivity of their inferences to different assumptions concerning the missing data mechanism. An example using MIDAS to impute missing data is presented and MIDAS is compared to existing missing data software.","Package exams provides a framework for automatic generation of standardized statistical exams which is especially useful for large-scale exams. To employ the tools, users just need to supply a pool of exercises and a master file controlling the layout of the final PDF document.  The exercises are specified in separate Sweave files (containing R code for data generation and LaTeX code for problem and solution description) and the master file is a LaTeX document with some additional control commands.  This paper gives an overview of the main design aims and principles as well as strategies for adaptation and extension. Hands-on illustrations---based on example exercises and control files provided in the package---are presented to get new users started easily.","An important component of quality control for statistical graphics software is the ability not only to test that code runs without errors, but also to test that code produces the right result. The simple way to test for the correct result in graphical output is to test whether a test file differs from a control file;  this is effective in determining whether a difference exists.  However, the test can be significantly enhanced by also producing a graphical image of any difference;  this makes it much easier to determine how and why two files differ.  This article describes the graphicsQC package for R, which provides functions for producing and comparing files of graphical output and for generating a report of the results, including images of any differences.","The fgui R package is designed for developers of R packages, to help rapidly, and sometimes fully automatically, create a graphical user interface for a command line R package. The interface is built upon the Tcl/Tk graphical interface included in R. The package further facilitates the developer by loading in the help files from the command line functions to provide context sensitive help to the user with no additional effort from the developer. Passing a function as the argument to the routines in the fgui package creates a graphical interface for the function, and further options are available to tweak this interface for those who want more flexibility.","The web-based, Java-written SOCR (Statistical Online Computational Resource) tools have been utilized in many undergraduate and graduate level statistics courses for seven years now (Dinov 2006; Dinov et al. 2008b).  It has been proven that these resources can successfully improve students' learning (Dinov et al. 2008b).  Being first published online in 2005, SOCR Analyses is a somewhat new component and it concentrate on data modeling for both parametric and non-parametric data analyses with graphical model diagnostics. One of the main purposes of SOCR Analyses is to facilitate statistical learning for high school and undergraduate students. As we have already implemented SOCR Distributions and Experiments, SOCR Analyses and Charts fulfill the rest of a standard statistics curricula. Currently, there are four core components of SOCR Analyses. Linear models included in SOCR Analyses are simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, one-way and two-way ANOVA. Tests for sample comparisons include t-test in the parametric category.  Some examples of SOCR Analyses' in the non-parametric category are Wilcoxon rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Friedman's test, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test and Fligner-Killeen test. Hypothesis testing models include contingency table, Friedman's test and Fisher's exact test. The last component of Analyses is a utility for computing sample sizes for normal distribution. In this article, we present the design framework, computational implementation and the utilization of SOCR Analyses.","This article describes an approach to importing vector-based graphical images into statistical software as implemented in a package called grImport for the R statistical computing environment. This approach assumes that an original image can be transformed into a PostScript format (i.e., the original image is in a standard vector graphics format such as PostScript, PDF, or SVG). The grImport package consists of three components: a function for converting PostScript files to an R-specific XML format; a function for reading the XML format into special Picture objects in R; and functions for manipulating and drawing Picture objects. Several examples and applications are presented, including annotating a statistical plot with an imported logo and using imported images as plotting symbols.","The POWERLIB SAS/IML software provides convenient power calculations for a wide range of multivariate linear models  with Gaussian errors. The software includes the Box, Geisser-Greenhouse, Huynh-Feldt, and uncorrected tests in the \"univariate\" approach to  repeated measures (UNIREP), the Hotelling Lawley Trace, Pillai-Bartlett Trace, and Wilks Lambda tests in \"multivariate\" approach (MULTIREP),  as well as a limited but useful range of mixed models. The familiar univariate linear model with Gaussian errors is an important special case.  For estimated covariance, the software provides confidence limits for the resulting estimated power. All power and confidence limits values can  be output to a SAS dataset, which can be used to easily produce plots and tables for manuscripts.","Sequential Monte Carlo methods are a very general class of Monte Carlo methods for sampling from sequences of distributions. Simple examples of these algorithms are used very widely in the tracking and signal processing literature. Recent developments illustrate that these techniques have much more general applicability, and can be applied very effectively to statistical inference problems. Unfortunately, these methods are often perceived as being computationally expensive and difficult to implement. This article seeks to address both of these problems. A C++ template class library for the efficient and convenient implementation of very general Sequential Monte Carlo algorithms is presented. Two example applications are provided: a simple particle filter for illustrative purposes and a state-of-the-art algorithm for rare event estimation.","Meta-analysis is a statistical methodology that combines or integrates the results of several independent clinical trials considered by the analyst to be 'combinable' (Huque 1988). However, completeness and user-friendliness are uncommon both in specialised meta-analysis software packages and in mainstream statistical packages that have to rely on user-written commands. We implemented the meta-analysis methodology in an Microsoft (Excel) add-in which is freely available and incorporates more meta-analysis models (including the iterative maximum likelihood and profile likelihood) than are usually available, while paying particular attention to the user-friendliness of the package.","Archetypal analysis has the aim to represent observations in a multivariate data set as convex combinations of extremal points. This approach was introduced by Cutler and Breiman (1994); they defined the concrete problem, laid out the theoretical foundations and presented an algorithm written in Fortran. In this paper we present the R package archetypes which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. The package provides an implementation of the archetypal analysis algorithm within R and different exploratory tools to analyze the algorithm during its execution and its final result. The application of the package is demonstrated on two examples.","This program is designed to improve causal inference via a method of matching that is widely applicable in observational data and easy to understand and use (if you understand how to draw a histogram, you will understand this method). The program implements the \ncoarsened exact matching (CEM) algorithm, described below. CEM may be used alone or in combination with any existing matching method. This algorithm, and its statistical properties, are described in Iacus, King, and Porro (2008).","Supervised learning can be used to segment/identify regions of interest in images using both color and morphological information. A novel object identification algorithm was developed in Java to locate immune and cancer cells in images of immunohistochemically-stained lymph node tissue from a recent study published by Kohrt et al. (2005). The algorithms are also showing promise in other domains. The success of the method depends heavily on the use of color, the relative homogeneity of object appearance and on interactivity. As is often the case in segmentation, an algorithm specifically tailored to the application works better than using broader methods that work passably well on any problem. Our main innovation is the interactive feature extraction from color images. We also enable the user to improve the classification with an interactive visualization system. This is then coupled with the statistical learning algorithms and intensive feedback  from the user over many classification-correction iterations, resulting in a highly accurate and user-friendly solution. The system ultimately provides the locations of every cell recognized in the entire tissue in a text file tailored to be easily imported into R (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996; R Development Core Team 2009) for further statistical analyses. This data is invaluable in the study of spatial and multidimensional relationships between cell populations and tumor structure.  This system is available at http://www.GemIdent.com together with three demonstration videos and a manual.\n\nThe code is now open-sourced and available on github at: https://github.com/kapelner/GemIdent","Designs for event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (ER-fMRI) that help to efficiently achieve the statistical goals while taking into account the psychological constraints and customized requirements are in great demand. This is not only because of the popularity of ER-fMRI but also because of the high cost of ER-fMRI experiments; being able to collect highly informative data is crucial. In this paper, we develop a MATLAB program which can accommodate many user-specified experimental conditions to efficiently find ER-fMRI optimal designs.","Biplots simultaneously provide information on both the samples and the variables of a data matrix in two- or three-dimensional representations. The BiplotGUI package provides a graphical user interface for the construction of, interaction with, and manipulation of biplots in R.  The samples are represented as points, with coordinates determined either by the choice of biplot, principal coordinate analysis or multidimensional scaling. Various transformations and dissimilarity metrics are available. Information on the original variables is incorporated  by linear or non-linear calibrated axes.  Goodness-of-fit measures are provided. Additional descriptors can be superimposed, including convex hulls, alpha-bags, point densities and classification regions. Amongst the interactive features are dynamic variable value prediction, zooming and point and axis drag-and-drop. Output can easily be exported to the R workspace for further manipulation.  Three-dimensional biplots are incorporated via the rgl package. The user requires almost no knowledge of R syntax.","Statistical process control (SPC) descibes a widely-used set of approaches used to detect shifts in processes in, for example, manufacturing.  Among these are \"control charts\".  Control charts and other SPC techniques have been in use since at least the 1950s, and, because they are comparatively unsophisticated, are often used by management or operations personnel without formal statistical training. These personnel will often have experience with the popular spreadsheet program Excel, but may have less training on a mainstream statistical package. Base Excel does not provide the ability to draw control charts directly, although add-ins for that purpose are available for purchase.\n\nWe present a free add-in for Excel that draws the most common sorts of control charts. It follows the development of the textbook of Montgomery (2005), so it may be well-suited for instructional purposes.","R is a mature open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. Many areas of statistical research are experiencing rapid growth in the size of data sets. Methodological advances drive increased use of simulations. A common approach is to use parallel computing.\n\nThis paper presents an overview of techniques for parallel computing with R on computer clusters, on multi-core systems, and in grid computing. It reviews sixteen different packages, comparing them on their state of development, the parallel technology used, as well as on usability, acceptance, and performance.\n\nTwo packages (snow, Rmpi) stand out as particularly suited to general use on computer clusters. Packages for grid computing are still in development, with only one package currently available to the end user. For multi-core systems five different packages exist, but a number of issues pose challenges to early adopters. The paper concludes with ideas for further developments in high performance computing with R.  Example code is available in the appendix.","We present data structures and algorithms for sets and some generalizations thereof (fuzzy sets, multisets, and fuzzy multisets) available for R through the sets package. Fuzzy (multi-)sets are based on dynamically bound fuzzy logic families.  Further extensions include user-definable iterators and matching functions.","In this paper we present the methodology of multidimensional scaling problems (MDS) solved by means of the majorization algorithm. The objective function to be minimized is known as stress and functions which majorize stress are elaborated. This strategy to solve MDS problems is called SMACOF and it is implemented in an R package of the same name which is presented in this article. We extend the basic SMACOF theory in terms of configuration constraints, three-way data, unfolding models, and projection of the resulting configurations onto spheres and other quadratic surfaces. Various examples are presented to show the possibilities of the SMACOF approach offered by the corresponding package.","Homogeneity analysis combines the idea of maximizing the correlations between variables of a multivariate data set with that of optimal scaling. In this article we present methodological and practical issues of the R package homals which performs homogeneity analysis and various extensions. By setting rank constraints nonlinear principal component analysis can be performed. The variables can be partitioned into sets such that homogeneity analysis is extended to nonlinear canonical correlation analysis or to predictive models which emulate discriminant analysis and regression models. For each model the scale level of the variables can be taken into account by setting level constraints. All algorithms allow for missing values.","Fechnerian scaling is a procedure for constructing a metric on a set of objects (e.g., colors, symbols, X-ray films, or even statistical models) to represent dissimilarities among the objects \"from the point of view\" of a system (e.g., person, technical device, or even computational algorithm) \"perceiving\" these objects. This metric, called Fechnerian, is computed from a data matrix of pairwise discrimination probabilities or any other pairwise measure which can be interpreted as the degree with which two objects within the set are discriminated from each other. This paper presents the package fechner for performing Fechnerian scaling of object sets in R. We describe the functions of the package. Fechnerian scaling then is demonstrated on real and artificial data sets accompanying the package.","Dynamic time warping is a popular technique for comparing time series, providing both a distance measure that is insensitive to local compression and stretches and the warping which optimally deforms one of the two input series onto the other.  A variety of algorithms and constraints have been discussed in the literature.  The dtw package provides an unification of them; it allows R users to compute time series alignments mixing freely a variety of continuity constraints, restriction windows, endpoints, local distance definitions, and so on. The package also provides functions for visualizing alignments and constraints using several classic diagram types.","Correspondence analysis (CA) is a popular method that can be used to analyse relationships between categorical variables. Like principal component analysis, CA solutions can be rotated both orthogonally and obliquely to simple structure without affecting the total amount of explained inertia. We describe a MATLAB package for computing CA. The package includes orthogonal and oblique rotation of axes.  It is designed not only for advanced users of MATLAB but also for beginners. Analysis can be done using a user-friendly interface, or by using command lines. We illustrate the use of CAR with one example.","Diffusion weighted imaging has become and will certainly continue to be an important tool in medical research and diagnostics. Data obtained with diffusion weighted imaging are characterized by a high noise level. Thus, estimation  of quantities like anisotropy indices or the main diffusion direction may be significantly compromised by noise in clinical or neuroscience applications.\n\nHere, we present a new package dti for R, which provides functions for the analysis of diffusion weighted data within the diffusion tensor model.  This includes smoothing by a recently proposed structural adaptive smoothing procedure based on the propagation-separation approach in the context of the widely used diffusion tensor model. We extend the procedure and show, how a correction for Rician bias can be incorporated. We use a heteroscedastic nonlinear regression model to estimate the diffusion tensor. The smoothing procedure naturally adapts to different structures of different size and thus avoids oversmoothing edges and fine structures.\n\nWe illustrate the usage and capabilities of the package through some examples.","Directional data is ubiquitious in science. Due to its circular nature such data cannot be analyzed with commonly used statistical techniques. Despite the rapid development of specialized methods for directional statistics over the last fifty years, there is only little software available that makes such methods easy to use for practioners. Most importantly, one of the most commonly used programming languages in biosciences, MATLAB, is currently not supporting directional statistics. To remedy this situation, we have implemented the CircStat toolbox for MATLAB which provides methods for the descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of directional data. We cover the statistical background of the available methods and describe how to apply them to data. Finally, we analyze a dataset from neurophysiology to demonstrate the capabilities of the CircStat toolbox.","This paper describes CADFtest, an R package for testing for the presence of a   unit root in a time series using the covariate-augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test proposed in Hansen (1995). The procedures presented here are user friendly, allow fully automatic model specification, and allow computation of the asymptotic p values of the test.","Taking advantage of the S4 class system of the programming environment R, which facilitates the creation and maintenance of reusable and modular components, an object-oriented framework for robust multivariate analysis was developed. The framework resides in the packages robustbase and rrcov and includes an almost complete set of algorithms for computing robust multivariate location and scatter, various robust methods for principal component analysis as well as robust linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. The design of these methods follows common patterns which we call statistical design patterns in analogy to the design patterns widely used in software engineering. The application of the framework to data analysis as well as possible extensions by the development of new methods is demonstrated on examples which themselves are part of the package rrcov.","We discuss R package BB, in particular, its capabilities for solving a nonlinear system of equations.  The function BBsolve in BB can be used for this purpose. We demonstrate the utility of these functions for solving: (a) large systems of nonlinear equations, (b) smooth, nonlinear estimating equations in statistical modeling, and \n(c) non-smooth estimating equations arising in rank-based regression modeling of censored failure time data. The function BBoptim can be used to solve smooth, box-constrained optimization problems. A main strength of BB is that, due to its low memory and storage requirements, it is ideally suited for solving high-dimensional problems with thousands of variables.","In this paper we give a general framework for isotone optimization. First we discuss a generalized version of the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) to minimize a separable convex function with simple chain constraints. Besides of general convex functions we extend existing PAVA implementations in terms of observation weights, approaches for tie handling, and responses from repeated measurement designs. Since isotone optimization problems can be formulated as convex programming problems with linear constraints we the develop a primal active set method to solve such problem. This methodology is applied on specific loss functions relevant in statistics. Both approaches are implemented in the R package isotone.","The mixtools package for R provides a set of functions for analyzing a variety of finite mixture models.  These functions include both traditional methods, such as EM algorithms for univariate and multivariate normal mixtures, and newer methods that reflect some recent research in finite mixture models.  In the latter category, mixtools provides algorithms for estimating parameters in a wide range of different mixture-of-regression contexts, in multinomial mixtures such as those arising from discretizing continuous multivariate data, in nonparametric situations where the multivariate component densities are completely unspecified, and in semiparametric situations such as a univariate location mixture of symmetric but otherwise unspecified densities. Many of the algorithms of the mixtools package are EM algorithms or are based on EM-like ideas, so this article includes an overview of EM algorithms for finite mixture models.","This article describes the recent package rsm, which was designed to provide R support for standard response-surface methods.  Functions are provided to generate central-composite and Box-Behnken designs.  For analysis of the resulting data, the package provides for estimating the response surface, testing its lack of fit, displaying an ensemble of contour plots of the fitted surface, and doing follow-up analyses such as steepest ascent, canonical analysis, and ridge analysis.  It also implements a coded-data structure to aid in this essential aspect of the methodology.  The functions are designed in hopes of providing an intuitive and effective user interface. Potential exists for expanding the package in a variety of ways.","Of the seven elementary catastrophes in catastrophe theory, the \"cusp\" model is the most widely applied. Most applications are however qualitative. Quantitative techniques for catastrophe modeling have been developed, but so far the limited availability of flexible software has hindered quantitative assessment. We present a package that implements and extends the method of Cobb (Cobb and Watson 1980; Cobb, Koppstein, and Chen 1983), and makes it easy to quantitatively fit and compare different cusp catastrophe models in a statistically principled way. After a short introduction to the cusp catastrophe, we demonstrate the package with two instructive examples.","In a series of papers De Leeuw developed a general framework for multivariate analysis with optimal scaling. The basic idea of optimal scaling is to transform the observed variables (categories) in terms of quantifications. In the approach presented here the multivariate data are collected into a multivariable. An aspect of a multivariable is a function that is used to measure how well the multivariable satisfies some criterion. Basically we can think of two different families of aspects which unify many well-known multivariate methods: Correlational aspects based on sums of correlations, eigenvalues and determinants which unify multiple regression, path analysis, correspondence analysis, nonlinear PCA, etc. Non-correlational aspects which linearize bivariate regressions and can be used for SEM preprocessing with categorical data. Additionally, other aspects can be established that do not correspond to classical techniques at all. By means of the R package aspect we provide a unified majorization-based implementation of this methodology. Using various data examples we will show the flexibility of this approach and how the optimally scaled results can be represented using graphical tools provided by the package.","Classical categorical regression models such as the multinomial logit and proportional odds models are shown to be readily handled by the  vector generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) framework. Additionally, there are natural extensions, such as reduced-rank VGLMs for dimension reduction, and allowing covariates that have values specific to each linear/additive predictor, e.g., for consumer choice modeling. This article describes some of the framework behind the VGAM R package, its usage and implementation details.","We provide user friendly software for Bayesian analysis of functional data models using pkg{WinBUGS}~1.4. The excellent properties of Bayesian analysis in this context are due to: (1) dimensionality reduction, which leads to low dimensional projection bases; (2) mixed model representation of functional models, which provides a modular approach to model extension; and (3) orthogonality of the principal component bases, which contributes to excellent chain convergence and mixing properties. Our paper provides one more, essential, reason for using Bayesian analysis for functional models: the existence of software.","Here we present and discuss the R package modTempEff including a set of functions aimed at modelling temperature effects on mortality with time series data. The functions fit a particular log linear model which allows to capture the two main features of mortality- temperature relationships: nonlinearity and distributed lag effect. Penalized splines and segmented regression constitute the core of the modelling framework. We briefly review the model and illustrate the functions throughout a simulated dataset.","Generalized linear mixed models provide a flexible framework for modeling a range of data, although with non-Gaussian response variables the likelihood cannot be obtained in closed form. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods solve this problem by sampling from a series of simpler conditional distributions that can be evaluated. The R package MCMCglmm implements such an algorithm for a range of model fitting problems. More than one response variable can be analyzed simultaneously, and these variables are allowed to follow Gaussian, Poisson, multi(bi)nominal, exponential, zero-inflated and censored distributions. A range of variance structures are permitted for the random effects, including interactions with categorical or continuous variables (i.e., random regression), and more complicated variance structures that arise through shared ancestry, either through a pedigree or through a phylogeny. Missing values are permitted in the response variable(s) and data can be known up to some level of measurement error as in meta-analysis. All simu- lation is done in C/ C++ using the CSparse library for sparse linear systems.","Mathematical simulation models are commonly applied to analyze experimental or environmental data and eventually to acquire predictive capabilities. Typically these models depend on poorly defined, unmeasurable parameters that need to be given a value. Fitting a model to data, so-called inverse modelling, is often the sole way of finding reasonable values for these parameters. There are many challenges involved in inverse model applications, e.g., the existence of non-identifiable parameters, the estimation of parameter uncertainties and the quantification of the implications of these uncertainties on model predictions.\n\nThe R package FME is a modeling package designed to confront a mathematical model with data. It includes algorithms for sensitivity and Monte Carlo analysis, parameter identifiability, model fitting and provides a Markov-chain based method to estimate parameter confidence intervals. Although its main focus is on mathematical systems that consist of differential equations, FME can deal with other types of models. In this paper, FME is applied to a model describing the dynamics of the HIV virus.","Determining the optimal number of clusters appears to be a persistent and controversial issue in cluster analysis. Most existing R packages targeting clustering require the user to specify the number of clusters in advance. However, if this subjectively chosen number is far from optimal, clustering may produce seriously misleading results. In order to address this vexing problem, we develop the R package clues to automate and evaluate the selection of an optimal number of clusters, which is widely applicable in the field of clustering analysis. Package clues uses two main procedures, shrinking and partitioning, to estimate an optimal number of clusters by maximizing an index function, either the CH index or the Silhouette index, rather than relying on guessing a pre-specified number. Five agreement indices (Rand index, Hubert and Arabie's adjusted Rand index, Morey and Agresti's adjusted Rand index, Fowlkes and Mallows index and Jaccard index), which measure the degree of agreement between any two partitions, are also provided in clues. In addition to numerical evidence, clues also supplies a deeper insight into the partitioning process with trajectory plots.","In many applications, such as physiology and finance, large time series data bases are to be analyzed requiring the computation of linear, nonlinear and other measures. Such measures have been developed and implemented in commercial and freeware softwares rather selectively and independently. The Measures of Analysis of Time Series (MATS) MATLAB toolkit is designed to handle an arbitrary large set of scalar time series and compute a large variety of measures on them, allowing for the specification of varying measure parameters as well. The variety of options with added facilities for visualization of the results support different settings of time series analysis, such as the detection of dynamics changes in long data records, resampling (surrogate or bootstrap) tests for independence and linearity with various test statistics, and discrimination power of different measures and for different combinations of their parameters. The basic features of MATS are presented and the implemented measures are briefly described. The usefulness of MATS is illustrated on some empirical examples along with screenshots.","This document describes the new features in version 2.x of the tgp package for R, implementing treed Gaussian process (GP) models. The topics covered include methods for dealing with categorical inputs and excluding inputs from the tree or GP part of the model; fully Bayesian sensitivity analysis for inputs/covariates; sequential optimization of black-box functions; and a new Monte Carlo method for inference in multi-modal posterior distributions that combines simulated tempering and importance sampling. These additions extend the functionality of tgp across all models in the hierarchy: from Bayesian linear models, to classification and regression trees (CART), to treed Gaussian processes with jumps to the limiting linear model. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the baseline functionality of the package, outlined in the first vignette (Gramacy 2007).","The grofit package was developed to fit many growth curves obtained under different conditions in order to derive a conclusive dose-response curve, for instance for a compound that potentially affects growth. grofit fits data to different parametric models and in addition provides a model free spline method to circumvent systematic errors that might occur within application of parametric methods. This amendment increases the reliability of the characteristic parameters (e.g.,lag phase, maximal growth rate, stationary phase) derived from a single growth curve. By relating obtained parameters to the respective condition (e.g.,concentration of a compound) a dose response curve can be derived that enables the calculation of descriptive pharma-/toxicological values like half maximum effective concentration (EC50). Bootstrap and cross-validation techniques are used for estimating confidence intervals of all derived parameters.","The case-control study is an important design for testing association between genetic markers and a disease. The Cochran-Armitage trend test (CATT) is one of the most commonly used statistics for the analysis of case-control genetic association studies. The asymptotically optimal CATT can be used when the underlying genetic model (mode of inheritance) is known. However, for most complex diseases, the underlying genetic models are unknown. Thus, tests robust to genetic model misspecification are preferable to the model-dependant CATT. Two robust tests, MAX3 and the genetic model selection (GMS), were recently proposed. Their asymptotic null distributions are often obtained by Monte-Carlo simulations, because they either have not been fully studied or involve multiple integrations. In this article, we study how components of each robust statistic are correlated, and find a linear dependence among the components. Using this new finding, we propose simple algorithms to calculate asymptotic null distributions for MAX3 and GMS, which greatly reduce the computing intensity. Furthermore, we have developed the R package Rassoc implementing the proposed algorithms to calculate the empirical and asymptotic p values for MAX3 and GMS as well as other commonly used tests in case-control association studies. For illustration, Rassoc is applied to the analysis of case-control data of 17 most significant SNPs reported in four genome-wide association studies.","In linear models and multivariate normal situations, prior information in linear inequality form may be encountered, or linear inequality hypotheses may be subjected to statistical tests. R package ic.infer has been developed to support inequality-constrained estimation and testing for such situations. This article gives an overview of the principles underlying inequality-constrained inference that are far less well-known than methods for unconstrained or equality-constrained models, and describes their implementation in the package.","This paper discusses a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution, the 'hyperdirichlet', in which various types of incomplete observations may be incorporated. It is conjugate to the multinomial distribution when some observations are censored or grouped. The hyperdirichlet R package is introduced and examples given. A number of statistical tests are performed on the example datasets, which are drawn from diverse disciplines including sports statistics, the sociology of climate change, and psephology.","The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.","Multidimensional item response models have been developed to incorporate a general trait and several specific trait dimensions. Depending on the structure of these latent traits, different models can be considered. This paper provides the requisite information and description of software that implement the Gibbs sampling procedures for three such models with a normal ogive form. The software developed is written in the MATLAB package IRTm2noHA. The package is flexible enough to allow a user the choice to simulate binary response data with a latent structure involving general and specific traits, specify prior distributions for model parameters, check convergence of the MCMC chain, and obtain Bayesian fit statistics. Illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate and validate the use of the software package.","This paper discusses the numerical precision of five spreadsheets (Calc, Excel, Gnumeric, NeoOffice and Oleo) running on two hardware platforms (i386 and amd64) and on three operating systems (Windows Vista, Ubuntu Intrepid and Mac OS Leopard). The methodology consists of checking the number of correct significant digits returned by each spreadsheet when computing the sample mean, standard deviation, first-order autocorrelation, F statistic in ANOVA tests, linear and nonlinear regression and distribution functions. A discussion about the algorithms for pseudorandom number generation provided by these platforms is also conducted. We conclude that there is no safe choice among the spreadsheets here assessed: they all fail in nonlinear regression and they are not suited for Monte Carlo experiments.","Synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions are important to consider when developing mixtures of anticancer or other types of drugs. Boik, Newman, and Boik (2008) proposed the MixLow method as an alternative to the Median-Effect method of Chou and Talalay (1984) for estimating drug interaction indices. One advantage of the MixLow method is that the nonlinear mixed-effects model used to estimate parameters of concentration-response curves can provide more accurate parameter estimates than the log linearization and least-squares analysis used in the Median-Effect method. This paper introduces the mixlow package in R, an implementation of the MixLow method. Results are reported for a small simulation study.","This paper describes an R package, rpartOrdinal, that implements alternative splitting functions for fitting a classification tree when interest lies in predicting an ordinal response. This includes the generalized Gini impurity function, which was introduced as a method for predicting an ordinal response by including costs of misclassification into the impurity function, as well as an alternative ordinal impurity function due to Piccarreta (2008) that does not require the assignment of misclassification costs. The ordered twoing splitting method, which is not defined as a decrease in node impurity, is also included in the package. Since, in the ordinal response setting, misclassifying observations to adjacent categories is a less egregious error than misclassifying observations to distant categories, this package also includes a function for estimating an ordinal measure of association, the gamma statistic.","The copula-based modeling of multivariate distributions with continuous margins is presented as a succession of rank-based tests: a multivariate test of randomness followed by a test of mutual independence and a series of goodness-of-fit tests. All the tests under consideration are based on the empirical copula, which is a nonparametric rank-based estimator of the true unknown copula. The principles of the tests are recalled and their implementation in the copula R package is briefly described. Their use in the construction of a copula model from data is thoroughly illustrated on real insurance and financial data.","The purpose of this paper is to describe the R package {PTAk and how the spatio-temporal context can be taken into account in the analyses.  Essentially  PTAk() is a multiway multidimensional method to decompose a multi-entries data-array, seen mathematically as  a tensor of any order.  This PTAk-modes method proposes a way of generalizing SVD (singular value decomposition), as well as some other well known methods included in the R package, such as PARAFAC or CANDECOMP and the PCAn-modes or Tucker-n model. The example datasets cover different domains with various spatio-temporal characteristics and issues:  (i)~medical imaging in neuropsychology with a functional MRI  (magnetic resonance imaging) study, (ii)~pharmaceutical research with a pharmacodynamic study with EEG (electro-encephaloegraphic) data for a central nervous system (CNS) drug, and (iii)~geographical information system (GIS) with a climatic dataset that characterizes arid and semi-arid variations. All the methods implemented in the R package PTAk also support non-identity metrics, as well as penalizations during the optimization process. As a result of these flexibilities, together with pre-processing facilities, PTAk constitutes a framework for devising extensions of multidimensional methods such ascorrespondence analysis, discriminant analysis, and multidimensional scaling, also enabling spatio-temporal constraints.","This paper shows how to estimate models by the generalized method of moments and the generalized empirical likelihood using the R package gmm. A brief discussion is offered on the theoretical aspects of both methods and the functionality of the package is presented through several examples in economics and finance.","We introduce glmulti, an R package for automated model selection and multi-model inference with glm and related functions. From a list of explanatory variables, the provided function glmulti  builds all possible unique models involving these variables and, optionally, their pairwise interactions. Restrictions can be specified for candidate models, by excluding specific terms, enforcing marginality, or controlling model complexity. Models are fitted with standard R functions like glm. The n best models and their support (e.g., (Q)AIC, (Q)AICc, or BIC) are returned, allowing model selection and multi-model inference through standard R functions. The package is optimized for large candidate sets by avoiding memory limitation, facilitating parallelization and providing, in addition to exhaustive screening, a compiled genetic algorithm method.  This article briefly presents the statistical framework and introduces the package, with applications to simulated and real data.","sphet is a package for estimating and testing spatial models with heteroskedastic innovations.  We implement recent generalized moments estimators and semiparametric methods for the estimation of the coefficients variance-covariance matrix. This paper is a general description of sphet and all functionalities are illustrated by application to the popular Boston housing dataset.  The package in its current version is limited to the estimators based on Arraiz, Drukker, Kelejian, and Prucha (2010); Kelejian and Prucha (2007, 2010). The estimation functions implemented in sphet are able to deal with virtually any sample size.","Quasi-least squares (QLS) is an alternative computational approach for estimation of the correlation parameter in the framework of generalized estimating equations (GEE). QLS overcomes some limitations of GEE that were discussed in Crowder (1995). In addition, it allows for easier implementation of some correlation structures that are not available for GEE.  We describe a user written SAS macro called %QLS, and demonstrate application of our macro using a clinical trial example for the comparison of two treatments for a common toenail infection.  %QLS also computes the lower and upper boundaries of the correlation parameter for analysis of longitudinal binary data that were described by Prentice (1988).  Furthermore, it displays a warning message if the Prentice constraints are violated. This warning is not provided in existing GEE software packages and other packages that were recently developed for application of QLS   (in Stata, MATLAB, and R). %QLS allows for analysis of continuous, binary, or count data with one of the following working correlation structures: the first-order autoregressive, equicorrelated, Markov, or tri-diagonal structures.","bnlearn is an R package (R Development Core Team 2010) which includes several algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks with either discrete or continuous variables. Both constraint-based and score-based algorithms are implemented, and can use the functionality provided by the snow package (Tierney et al. 2008) to improve their performance via parallel computing. Several network scores and conditional independence algorithms are available for both the learning algorithms and independent use. Advanced plotting options are provided by the Rgraphviz package (Gentry et al. 2010).","This user guide describes a Python package, PyMC, that allows users to efficiently code a probabilistic model and draw samples from its posterior distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques.","Clustering streams of continuously arriving data has become an important application of data mining in recent years and efficient algorithms have been proposed by several researchers. However, clustering alone neglects the fact that data in a data stream is not only characterized by the proximity of data points which is used by clustering, but also by a temporal component. The extensible Markov model (EMM) adds the temporal component to data stream clustering by superimposing a dynamically adapting Markov chain. In this paper we introduce the implementation of the R extension package rEMM which implements EMM and we discuss some examples and applications.","The assessment of dose-response is an integral component of the drug development process. Parallel dose-response studies are conducted, customarily, in preclinical and phase 1, 2 clinical trials for this purpose. Practical constraints on dose range, dose levels and dose proportions are intrinsic issues in the design of dose response studies because of drug toxicity, efficacy, FDA regulations, protocol requirements, clinical trial logistics, and marketing issues. We provide a free on-line software package called Controlled Optimal Design 2.0 for generating controlled optimal designs that can incorporate prior information and multiple objectives, and meet multiple practical constraints at the same time.  Researchers can either run the web-based design program or download its stand-alone version to construct the desired multiple-objective controlled Bayesian optimal designs.  Because researchers often adopt ad-hoc design schemes such as the equal allocation rules without knowing how efficient such designs would be for the design problem, the program also evaluates the efficiency of user-supplied designs.","This paper describes Mateda-2.0, a MATLAB package for estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs). This  package can be used to solve  single and multi-objective discrete and continuous optimization problems using EDAs based on undirected and directed probabilistic graphical models. The implementation contains several methods commonly employed by EDAs.  It is also conceived as an open package to allow users to incorporate different combinations of selection, learning, sampling, and local search procedures. Additionally, it includes methods  to extract, process and visualize the structures learned by the probabilistic models. This way, it can unveil previously unknown information about the optimization problem domain. Mateda-2.0 also incorporates a module for creating and validating function models based on the probabilistic models learned by EDAs.","This paper describes the package PtProcess which uses the R statistical language. The package provides a unified approach to fitting and simulating a wide variety of temporal point process or temporal marked point process models. The models are specified by an intensity function which is conditional on the history of the process. The user needs to provide routines for calculating the conditional intensity function. Then the package enables one to carry out maximum likelihood fitting, goodness of fit testing, simulation and comparison of models. The package includes the routines for the conditional intensity functions for a variety of standard point process models. The package is intended to simplify the fitting of point process models indexed by time in much the same way as generalized linear model programs have simplified the fitting of various linear models. The primary examples used in this paper are earthquake sequences but the package is intended to have a much wider applicability.","In longitudinal studies measurements are often collected on different types of outcomes for each subject. These may include several longitudinally measured responses (such as blood values relevant to the medical condition under study) and the time at which an event of particular interest occurs (e.g., death, development of a disease or dropout from the study). These outcomes are often separately analyzed; however, in many instances, a joint modeling approach is either required or may produce a better insight into the mechanisms that underlie the phenomenon under study. In this paper we present the R package JM that fits joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data.","Package distrMod provides an object oriented (more specifically S4-style) implementation of probability models. Moreover, it contains functions and methods to compute minimum criterion estimators - in particular, maximum likelihood and minimum distance estimators.","Zero-inflation problem is very common in ecological studies as well as other areas. Nonparametric regression with zero-inflated data may be studied via the zero-inflated generalized additive model (ZIGAM), which assumes that the zero-inflated responses come from a probabilistic mixture of zero and a regular component whose distribution belongs to the 1-parameter exponential family. With the further assumption that the probability of non-zero-inflation is some monotonic function of the mean of the regular component, we propose the constrained zero-inflated generalized additive model (COZIGAM) for analyzingzero-inflated data. When the hypothesized constraint obtains, the new approach provides a unified framework for modeling zero-inflated data, which is more parsimonious and efficient than the unconstrained ZIGAM. We have developed an R package COZIGAM which contains functions that implement an iterative algorithm for fitting ZIGAMs and COZIGAMs to zero-inflated data basedon the penalized likelihood approach. Other functions included in the packageare useful for model prediction and model selection. We demonstrate the use ofthe COZIGAM package via some simulation studies and a real application.","The R package plink has been developed to facilitate the linking of mixed-format tests for multiple groups under a common item design using unidimensional and multidimensional IRT-based methods. This paper presents the capabilities of the package in the context of the unidimensional methods. The package supports nine unidimensional item response models (the Rasch model, 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, graded response model, partial credit and generalized partial credit model, nominal response model, and multiple-choice model) and four separate calibration linking methods (mean/sigma, mean/mean, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord). It also includes functions for importing item and/or ability parameters from common IRT software, conducting IRT true-score and observed-score equating, and plotting item response curves and parameter comparison plots.","Since zero-coupon rates are rarely directly observable, they have to be estimated from market data. In this paper we review several widely-used parametric term structure estimation methods. We propose a  weighted constrained optimization procedure with analytical gradients and a globally optimal start parameter search algorithm. Moreover, we introduce the R package termstrc, which offers a wide range of functions for  term structure estimation based on static and dynamic coupon bond and yield data sets. It provides extensive summary statistics and plots to compare the results of the different estimation methods.  We illustrate the application of the package through practical examples using market data from European government bonds and yields.","For right-censored data perhaps the most commonly used tests are weighted logrank tests, such as the logrank and Wilcoxon-type tests. In this paper we review several generalizations of those weighted logrank tests to interval-censored data and present an R package, interval, to implement many of them.  The interval package depends on the perm package, also presented here, which performs exact and asymptotic linear permutation tests.  The perm package performs many of the tests included in the already available coin package, and provides an independent validation of coin.  We review analysis methods for interval-censored data, and we describe and show how to use the interval and perm packages.","The metafor package provides functions for conducting meta-analyses in R. The package includes functions for fitting the meta-analytic fixed- and random-effects models and allows for the inclusion of moderators variables (study-level covariates) in these models. Meta-regression analyses with continuous and categorical moderators can be conducted in this way.  Functions for the Mantel-Haenszel and Peto's one-step method for meta-analyses of 2 x 2 table data are also available. Finally, the package provides various plot functions (for example, for forest, funnel, and radial plots) and functions for assessing the model fit, for obtaining case diagnostics, and for tests of publication bias.","To simulate fractional Brownian motion indexed by a manifold poses serious numerical problems: storage, computing time and choice of an appropriate grid.  We propose an effective and fast method, valid not only for fractional Brownian fields indexed by a manifold, but for any Gaussian fields indexed by a manifold. The performance of our method is illustrated with different manifolds (sphere, hyperboloid).","The tolerance package for R provides a set of functions for estimating and plotting tolerance limits.  This package provides a wide-range of functions for estimating discrete and continuous tolerance intervals as well as for estimating regression tolerance intervals.  An additional tool of the tolerance package is the plotting capability for the univariate and regression settings as well as for the multivariate normal setting.  The tolerance package's capabilities are illustrated using simulated data sets.  Formulas used for the estimation procedures are also presented.","The amei package for R is a tool that provides a flexible statistical framework for generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging epidemic. Uncertainty regarding the underlying disease parameters is propagated through to the decision process via Bayesian posterior inference.  The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates.  This document briefly covers the background and methodology underpinning the implementation provided by the package and contains extensive examples showing the functions and methods in action.","depmixS4 implements a general framework for defining and estimating dependent mixture models in the R programming language.  This includes standard Markov models, latent/hidden Markov models, and latent class and finite mixture distribution models.  The models can be fitted on mixed multivariate data with distributions from the glm family, the (logistic) multinomial, or the multivariate normal distribution.  Other distributions can be added easily, and an example is provided with the exgaus distribution.  Parameters are estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm or, when (linear) constraints are imposed on the parameters, by direct numerical optimization with the Rsolnp or Rdonlp2 routines.","The 3-dimensional representation and inspection of complex data is a frequently used strategy in many data analysis domains.  Existing data mining software often lacks functionality that would enable users to explore 3D data interactively, especially if one wishes to make dynamic graphical representations directly viewable on the web.\n   \nIn this paper we present vrmlgen, a software package for the statistical programming language R to create 3D data visualizations in web formats like the Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML) and LiveGraphics3D. vrmlgen can be used to generate 3D charts and bar plots, scatter plots with density estimation contour surfaces, and visualizations of height maps, 3D object models and parametric functions. For greater flexibility, the user can also access low-level plotting methods through a unified interface and freely group different function calls together to create new higher-level plotting methods. Additionally, we present a web tool allowing users to visualize 3D data online and test some of vrmlgen's features without the need to install any software on their computer.","Cluster ensembles have emerged as a powerful meta-learning paradigm that provides improved accuracy and robustness by aggregating several input data clusterings. In particular, link-based similarity methods have recently been introduced with superior performance to the conventional co-association approach.  This paper presents a MATLAB package, LinkCluE, that implements the link-based cluster ensemble framework. A variety of functional methods for evaluating clustering results, based on both internal and external criteria, are also provided.  Additionally, the underlying algorithms together with the sample uses of the package with interesting real and synthetic datasets are demonstrated herein.","spam is an R package for sparse matrix algebra with emphasis on a Cholesky factorization of sparse positive definite matrices. The implemantation of spam is based on the competing philosophical maxims to be competitively fast compared to existing tools and to be easy to use, modify and extend. The first is addressed by using fast Fortran routines and the second by assuring S3 and S4 compatibility.  One of the features of spam is to exploit the algorithmic steps of the Cholesky factorization and hence to perform only a fraction of the workload when factorizing matrices with the same sparsity structure.  Simulations show that exploiting this break-down of the factorization results in a speed-up of about a factor 5 and memory savings of about a factor 10 for large matrices and slightly smaller factors for huge matrices.  The article is motivated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Gaussian Markov random fields, but many other statistical applications are mentioned that profit from an efficient Cholesky factorization as well.","This article describes a R package Boruta, implementing a novel feature selection algorithm for finding emph{all relevant variables}.  The algorithm is designed as a wrapper around a Random Forest classification algorithm. It iteratively removes the features which are proved by a statistical test to be less relevant than random probes. The Boruta package provides a convenient interface to the algorithm. The short description of the algorithm and examples of its application are presented.","We describe an R package focused on Bayesian analysis of dynamic linear models. The main features of the package are its flexibility to deal with a variety of constant or time-varying, univariate or multivariate models, and the numerically stable singular value decomposition-based algorithms used for filtering and smoothing. In addition to the examples of \"out-of-the-box\" use, we illustrate how the package can be used in advanced applications to implement a Gibbs sampler for a user-specified model.","The statistical analysis of data which is measured over a spatial region is well established as a scientific tool which makes considerable contributions to a wide variety of application areas.  Further development of these tools also remains a central part of the research scene in statistics.  However, understanding of the concepts involved often benefits from an intuitive and experimental approach, as well as a formal description of models and methods. This paper describes software which is intended to assist in this understanding. The role of simulation is advocated, in order to explain the meaning of spatial correlation and to interpret the parameters involved in standard models. Realistic scenarios where decisions on the locations of sampling points in a spatial setting are required are also described.  Students are provided with a variety of sampling strategies and invited to select the most appropriate one in two different settings.  One involves water sampling in the lagoon of the Mururoa Atoll while the other involves sea bed sampling in a Scottish firth. Once a student has decided on a sampling strategy, simulated data are provided for further analysis.  This extends the range of teaching activity from the analysis of data collected by others to involvement in data collection and the need to grapple with issues of design.  It is argued that this approach has significant benefits in learning.","This paper presents the R package gRapHD for efficient selection of high-dimensional undirected graphical models. The package provides tools for selecting trees, forests, and decomposable models minimizing information criteria such as AIC or BIC, and for displaying the independence graphs of the models. It has also some useful tools for analysing graphical structures. It supports the use of discrete, continuous, or both types of variables.","Knowledge space theory is part of psychometrics and provides a theoretical framework for the modeling, assessment, and training of knowledge. It utilizes the idea that some pieces of knowledge may imply others, and is based on order and set theory. We introduce the R package DAKS for performing basic and advanced operations in knowledge space theory. This package implements three inductive item tree analysis algorithms for deriving quasi orders from binary data, the original, corrected, and minimized corrected algorithms, in sample as well as population quantities. It provides functions for computing population and estimated asymptotic variances of and one and two sample Z tests for the diff fit measures, and for switching between test item and knowledge state representations. Other features are a function for computing response pattern and knowledge state frequencies, a data (based on a finite mixture latent variable model) and quasi order simulation tool, and a Hasse diagram drawing device. We describe the functions of the package and demonstrate their usage by real and simulated data examples.","Simulation studies are widely used by statisticians to gain insight into the quality of developed methods. Usually some guidelines regarding, e.g., simulation designs, contamination, missing data models or evaluation criteria are necessary in order to draw meaningful conclusions. The R package simFrame is an object-oriented framework for statistical simulation, which allows researchers to make use of a wide range of simulation designs with a minimal effort of programming. Its object-oriented implementation provides clear interfaces for extensions by the user. Since statistical simulation is an embarrassingly parallel process, the framework supports parallel computing to increase computational performance. Furthermore, an appropriate plot method is selected automatically depending on the structure of the simulation results. In this paper, the implementation of simFrame is discussed in great detail and the functionality of the framework is demonstrated in examples for different simulation designs.","We provide several illustrations of Bayesian semiparametric regression analyses in the BRugs package. BRugs facilitates use of the BUGS inference engine from the R computing environment and allows analyses to be managed using scripts. The examples are chosen to represent an array of non-standard situations, for which mixed model software is not viable. The situations include: the response variable being outside of the one-parameter exponential family, data subject to missingness, data subject to measurement error and parameters entering the model via an index.","The US Decennial Census is arguably the most important data set for social science research in the United States. The UScensus2000 suite of packages allows for convenient handling of the 2000 US Census spatial and demographic data. The goal of this article is to showcase the UScensus2000 suite of packages for R, to describe the data contained within these packages, and to demonstrate the helper functions provided for handling this data. The  UScensus2000 suite is comprised of spatial and demographic data for the 50 states and Washington DC at four different geographic levels (block, block group, tract, and census designated place). The UScensus2000 suite also contains a number of functions for selecting and aggregating specific geographies or demographic information such as metropolitan statistical areas, counties, etc. These packages rely heavily on the spatial tools developed by bivand08, i.e., the sp and maptools packages. This article will provide the necessary background for working with this data set, helper functions, and finish with an applied spatial statistics example.","In this paper, the R package DTDA for analyzing truncated data is described.  This package contains tools for performing three different but related algorithms to compute the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of the survival function in the presence of random truncation.  More precisely, the package implements the algorithms proposed by Efron and Petrosian (1999) and Shen (2008), for analyzing randomly one-sided and two-sided (i.e., doubly) truncated data. These algorithms and some recent extensions are briefly reviewed.  Two real data sets are used to show how DTDA package works in practice.","Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are growing in popularity as a complement or alternative to the traditional command line interfaces to R. RGtk2 is an R package for creating GUIs in R. The package provides programmatic access to GTK+ 2.0, an open-source GUI toolkit written in C. To construct a GUI, the R programmer calls RGtk2 functions that map to functions in the underlying GTK+ library. This paper introduces the basic concepts underlying GTK+ and explains how to use RGtk2 to construct GUIs from R. The tutorial is based on simple and pratical programming examples. We also provide more complex examples illustrating the advanced features of the package. The design of the RGtk2 API and the low-level interface from R to GTK+ are discussed at length. We compare RGtk2 to alternative GUI toolkits for R.","There is a clear growing interest, at least in the statistical literature, in competing risks and multi-state models. With the rising interest in competing risks and multi-state models a number of software packages have been developed for the analysis of such models. The present special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software introduces a selection of R packages devoted to competing risks and multi-state models. This introduction to the special issue contains some background and highlights the contents of the contributions.","In longitudinal studies of disease, patients can experience several events across a followup period. Analysis of such studies can be successfully performed by multi-state models. In the multi-state framework, issues of interest include the study of the relationship between covariates and disease evolution, estimation of transition probabilities, and survival rates. This paper introduces p3state.msm, a software application for R which performs inference in an illness-death model. It describes the capabilities of the program for estimating semi-parametric regression models and for implementing nonparametric estimators for several quantities. The main feature of the package is its ability for obtaining nonMarkov estimates for the transition probabilities. Moreover, the methods can also be used in progressive three-state models. In such a model, estimators for other quantities, such as the bivariate distribution function (for sequentially ordered events), are also given. The software is illustrated using data from the Stanford Heart Transplant Study.","Multi-State models provide a relevant framework for modelling complex event histories. Quantities of interest are the transition probabilities that can be estimated by the empirical transition matrix, that is also referred to as the Aalen-Johansen estimator. In this paper, we present the R package etm that computes and displays the transition probabilities. etm also features a Greenwood-type estimator of the covariance matrix. The use of the package is illustrated through a prominent example in bone marrow transplant for leukaemia patients.","The Lexis class in the R package Epi provides an object-based framework for managing follow-up time on multiple time scales, which is an important feature of prospective epidemiological studies with long duration. Follow-up time may be split either into fixed time bands, or on individual event times and the split data may be used in Poisson regression models that account for the evolution of disease risk on multiple time scales. The summary and plot methods for Lexis objects allow inspection of the follow-up times.","The Lexis class in the R package Epi provides tools for creation, manipulation and display of data from multi-state models. Transitions between states are described by rates (intensities); Lexis objects represent this kind of data and provide tools to show states and transitions annotated by relevant summary numbers. Data can be transformed to a form that allows modelling of several transition rates with common parameters.","Multi-state models are a very useful tool to answer a wide range of questions in survival analysis that cannot, or only in a more complicated way, be answered by classical models. They are suitable for both biomedical and other applications in which time-to-event variables are analyzed. However, they are still not frequently applied. So far, an important reason for this has been the lack of available software. To overcome this problem, we have developed the mstate package in R for the analysis of multi-state models. The package covers all steps of the analysis of multi-state models, from model building and data preparation to estimation and graphical representation of the results. It can be applied to non- and semi-parametric (Cox) models. The package is also suitable for competing risks models, as they are a special category of multi-state models.\n\nThis article offers guidelines for the actual use of the software by means of an elaborate multi-state analysis of data describing post-transplant events of patients with blood cancer. The data have been provided by the EBMT (the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation). Special attention will be paid to the modeling of different covariate effects (the same for all transitions or transition-specific) and different baseline hazard assumptions (different for all transitions or equal for some).","Panel data are observations of a continuous-time process at arbitrary times, for example, visits to a hospital to diagnose disease status. Multi-state models for such data are generally based on the Markov assumption. This article reviews the range of Markov models and their extensions which can be fitted to panel-observed data, and their implementation in the msm package for R. Transition intensities may vary between individuals, or with piecewise-constant time-dependent covariates, giving an inhomogeneous Markov model. Hidden Markov models can be used for multi-state processes which are misclassified or observed only through a noisy marker. The package is intended to be straightforward to use, flexible and comprehensively documented. Worked examples are given of the use of msm to model chronic disease progression and screening. Assessment of model fit, and potential future developments of the software, are also discussed.","The estimation of kernel-smoothed relative risk functions is a useful approach to examining the spatial variation of disease risk.  Though there exist several options for performing kernel density estimation in statistical software packages, there have been very few contributions to date that have focused on estimation of a relative risk function per se.  Use of a variable or adaptive smoothing parameter for estimation of the individual densities has been shown to provide additional benefits in estimating relative risk and specific computational tools for this approach are essentially absent.  Furthermore, little attention has been given to providing methods in available software for any kind of subsequent analysis with respect to an estimated risk function.  To facilitate analyses in the field, the R package sparr is introduced, providing the ability to construct both fixed and adaptive kernel-smoothed densities and risk functions, identify statistically significant fluctuations in an estimated risk function through the use of asymptotic tolerance contours, and visualize these objects in flexible and attractive ways.","Support in R for state space estimation via Kalman filtering was limited to one package, until fairly recently. In the last five years, the situation has changed with no less than four additional packages offering general implementations of the Kalman filter, including in some cases smoothing, simulation smoothing and other functionality.  This paper reviews some of the offerings in R to help the prospective user to make an informed choice.","We introduce a new MATLAB software package that implements several recently proposed likelihood-based methods for sufficient dimension reduction. Current capabilities include estimation of reduced subspaces with a fixed dimension d, as well as estimation of d by use of likelihood-ratio testing, permutation testing and information criteria. The methods are suitable for preprocessing data for both regression and classification. Implementations of related estimators are also available. Although the software is more oriented to command-line operation, a graphical user interface is also provided for prototype computations.","This paper describes the R package mhsmm which implements estimation and prediction methods for hidden Markov and semi-Markov models for multiple observation sequences. Such techniques are of interest when observed data is thought to be dependent on some unobserved (or hidden) state. Hidden Markov models only allow a geometrically distributed sojourn time in a given state, while hidden semi-Markov models extend this by allowing an arbitrary sojourn distribution. We demonstrate the software with simulation examples and an application involving the modelling of the ovarian cycle of dairy cows.","We introduce a pathwise algorithm for the Cox proportional hazards model, regularized by convex combinations of l1 and l2 penalties (elastic net). Our algorithm fits via cyclical coordinate descent, and employs warm starts to find a solution along a regularization path. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on real and simulated data sets, and find considerable speedup between our algorithm and competing methods.","Maximum likelihood estimation of a log-concave density has attracted considerable attention over the last few years. Several algorithms have been proposed to estimate such a density. Two of those algorithms, an iterative convex minorant and an active set algorithm, are implemented in the R package logcondens. While these algorithms are discussed elsewhere, we describe in this paper the use of the logcondens package and discuss functions and datasets related to log-concave density estimation contained in the package. In particular, we provide functions to (1) compute the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) as well as a smoothed log-concave density estimator derived from the MLE, (2) evaluate the estimated density, distribution and quantile functions at arbitrary points, (3) compute the characterizing functions of the MLE, (4) sample from the estimated distribution, and finally (5) perform a two-sample permutation test using a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic. In addition, logcondens makes two datasets available that have been used to illustrate log-concave density estimation.","In order to facilitate teaching complex topics in an interactive way, the authors developed a computer-assisted teaching system, a graphical user interface named TGUI (Teaching Graphical User Interface). TGUI was introduced at the beginning of 2009 in the Austrian Journal of Statistics (Dinges and Templ 2009) as being an effective instrument to train and teach staff on mathematical and statistical topics. While the fundamental principles were retained, the current TGUI system has been undergone a complete redesign. The ultimate goal behind the reimplementation was to share the advantages of TGUI and provide teachers and people who need to hold training courses with a strong tool that can enrich their lectures with interactive features. The idea was to go a step beyond the current modular blended-learning systems (see, e.g., Da Rin 2003) or the related teaching techniques of classroom-voting (see, e.g., Cline 2006). In this paper the authors have attempted to exemplify basic idea and concept of TGUI by means of statistics seminars held at Statistics Austria. The powerful open source software R  (R Development Core Team 2010a) is the backend for TGUI, which can therefore be used to process even complex statistical contents. However, with specifically created contents the interactive TGUI system can be used to support a wide range of courses and topics. The open source R packages TGUICore and TGUITeaching are freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at http://CRAN.R-project.org/.","Logistic regression provides a flexible framework for detecting various types of differential item functioning (DIF). Previous efforts extended the framework by using item response theory (IRT) based trait scores, and by employing an iterative process using group--specific item parameters to account for DIF in the trait scores, analogous to purification approaches used in other DIF detection frameworks. The current investigation advances the technique by developing a computational platform integrating both statistical and IRT procedures into a single program. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation approach was incorporated to derive empirical criteria for various DIF statistics and effect size measures. For purposes of illustration, the procedure was applied to data from a questionnaire of anxiety symptoms for detecting DIF associated with age from the Patient--Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System.","The package nacopula provides procedures for constructing nested Archimedean copulas in any dimensions and with any kind of nesting structure, generating vectors of random variates from the constructed objects, computing function values and probabilities of falling into hypercubes, as well as evaluation of characteristics such as Kendall's tau and the tail-dependence coefficients. As by-products, algorithms for various distributions, including exponentially tilted stable and Sibuya distributions, are implemented. Detailed examples are given.","Data from many scientific areas often come with measurement error. Density or distribution function estimation from contaminated data and nonparametric regression with errors in variables are two important topics in measurement error models. In this paper, we present a new software package decon for R, which contains a collection of functions that use the deconvolution kernel methods to deal with the measurement error problems. The functions allow the errors to be either homoscedastic or heteroscedastic.  To make the deconvolution estimators computationally more efficient in R, we adapt the fast Fourier transform algorithm for density estimation with error-free data to the deconvolution kernel estimation. We discuss the practical selection of the smoothing parameter in deconvolution methods and illustrate the use of the package through both simulated and real examples.","We propose an algorithm to compute the cumulative distribution function of the two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic Dn and its complementary distribution in a fast and reliable way. Different approximations are used in different regions of n, x. Java and C programs are available.","In this paper we elaborate on the potential of the lmer function from the lme4 package in R for item response (IRT) modeling. In line with the package, an IRT framework is described based on generalized linear mixed modeling. The aspects of the framework refer to (a) the kind of covariates -- their mode (person, item, person-by-item), and their being external vs. internal to responses, and (b) the kind of effects the covariates have -- fixed vs. random, and if random, the mode across which the effects are random (persons, items). Based on this framework, three broad categories of models are described: Item covariate models, person covariate models, and person-by-item covariate models, and within each category three types of more specific models are discussed. The models in question are explained and the associated lmer code is given. Examples of models are the linear logistic test model with an error term, differential item functioning models, and local item dependency models. Because the lme4 package is for univariate generalized linear mixed models, neither the two-parameter, and three-parameter models, nor the item response models for polytomous response data, can be estimated with the lmer function.","The R package HGLMMM has been developed to fit generalized linear models with random effects using the h-likelihood approach. The response variable is allowed to follow a binomial, Poisson, Gaussian or gamma distribution. The distribution of random effects can be specified as Gaussian, gamma, inverse-gamma or beta. Complex structures as multi-membership design or multilevel designs can be handled. Further, dispersion parameters of random components and the residual dispersion (overdispersion) can be modeled as a function of covariates. Overdispersion parameter can be fixed or estimated. Fixed effects in the mean structure can be estimated using extended likelihood or a first order Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood. Dispersion parameters are estimated using first order adjusted profile likelihood.","Many data analysis problems involve the application of a split-apply-combine strategy, where you break up a big problem into manageable pieces, operate on each piece independently and then put all the pieces back together. This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored.\n\nThe paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.","This paper presents the lubridate package for R, which facilitates working with dates and times. Date-times create various technical problems for the data analyst. The paper highlights these problems and offers practical advice on how to solve them using lubridate.  The paper also introduces a conceptual framework for arithmetic with date-times in R.","Data analysis sometimes requires the relaxation of parametric assumptions in order to gain modeling flexibility and robustness against mis-specification of the probability model. In the Bayesian context, this is accomplished by placing a prior distribution on a function space, such as the space of all probability distributions or the space of all regression functions. Unfortunately, posterior distributions ranging over function spaces are highly complex and hence sampling methods play a key role. This paper provides an introduction to a simple, yet comprehensive, set of programs for the implementation of some Bayesian nonparametric and semiparametric models in R, DPpackage. Currently, DPpackage includes models for marginal and conditional density estimation, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, interval-censored data, binary regression data, item response data, longitudinal and clustered data using generalized linear mixed models, and regression data using generalized additive models. The package also contains functions to compute pseudo-Bayes factors for model comparison and for eliciting the precision parameter of the Dirichlet process prior, and a general purpose Metropolis sampling algorithm. To maximize computational efficiency, the actual sampling for each model is carried out using compiled C, C++ or Fortran code.","This article describes the R package DEoptim, which implements the differential evolution algorithm for global optimization of a real-valued function of a real-valued parameter vector. The implementation of differential evolution in DEoptim interfaces with C code for efficiency. The utility of the package is illustrated by case studies in fitting a Parratt model for X-ray reflectometry data and a Markov-switching generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model for the returns of the Swiss Market Index.","The wgaim (whole genome average interval mapping) package developed in the R system for statistical computing (R Development Core Team 2011) builds on linear mixed modelling techniques by incorporating a whole genome approach to detecting significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) in bi-parental populations. Much of the sophistication is inherited through the well established linear mixed modelling package ASReml-R (Butler et al. 2009). As wgaim uses an extension of interval mapping to incorporate the whole genome into the analysis, functions are provided which allow conversion of genetic data objects created with the qtl package of Broman and Wu (2010) available in R. Results of QTL analyses are available using summary and print methods as well as diagnostic summaries of the selection method. In addition, the package features a flexible linkage map plotting function that can be easily manipulated to provide an aesthetic viewable genetic map. As a visual summary, QTL obtained from one or more models can also be added to the linkage map.","The Rcpp package simplifies integrating C++ code with R. It provides a consistent C++ class hierarchy that maps various types of R objects (vectors, matrices, functions, environments, . . . ) to dedicated C++ classes. Object interchange between R and C++ is managed by simple, flexible and extensible concepts which include broad support for C++ Standard Template Library idioms. C++ code can both be compiled, linked and loaded on the fly, or added via packages. Flexible error and exception code handling is provided. Rcpp substantially lowers the barrier for programmers wanting to combine C++ code with R.","We introduce an R package SPECIES for species richness or diversity estimation. This package provides simple R functions to compute point and confidence interval estimates of species number from a few nonparametric and semi-parametric methods. For the methods based on nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation, the R functions are wrappers for Fortran codes for better efficiency. All functions in this package are illustrated using real data sets.","In this paper, we present an R package that combines feature-based (X) data and graph-based (G) data for prediction of the response Y . In this particular case, Y is observed for a subset of the observations (labeled) and missing for the remainder (unlabeled).\nWe examine an approach for fitting Y = X? + f(G) where ? is a coefficient vector and f is a function over the vertices of the graph. The procedure is semi-supervised in nature (trained on the labeled and unlabeled sets), requiring iterative algorithms for fitting this estimate. The package provides several key functions for fitting and evaluating an estimator of this type. The package is illustrated on a text analysis data set, where the observations are text documents (papers), the response is the category of paper (either applied or theoretical statistics), the X information is the name of the journal in which the paper resides, and the graph is a co-citation network, with each vertex an observation and each edge the number of times that the two papers cite a common paper. An application involving classification of protein location using a protein interaction graph and an application involving classification on a manifold with part of the feature data converted to a graph are also presented.","In this paper we describe the SimultAn package dedicated to simultaneous analysis. Simultaneous analysis is a new factorial methodology developed for the joint treatment of a set of several data tables. Since the first stage of simultaneous analysis requires a correspondence analysis of each table the package comprises two parts, one for correspondence analysis and one for simultaneous analysis. The package can be used to perform classical correspondence analysis of frequency/contingency tables as well as to perform simultaneous analysis of a set of frequency/contingency tables. In this package, functions for computation, summaries and graphical visualization in two dimensions are provided, including options to display partial rows and supplementary points.","Genotyping platforms such as Affymetrix can be used to assess genotype-phenotype as well as copy number-phenotype associations at millions of markers. While genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when assessed on HapMap samples, tools to assess copy number changes are more variable and often discordant. One explanation for the discordance is that copy number estimates are susceptible to systematic differences between groups of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not adjust for batch effects are prone to spurious measures of association. The R package crlmm implements a multilevel model that adjusts for batch effects and provides allele-specific estimates of copy number. This paper illustrates a workflow for the estimation of allele-specific copy number and integration of the marker-level estimates with complimentary Bioconductor software for inferring regions of copy number gain or loss. All analyses are performed in the statistical environment R.","Topic models allow the probabilistic modeling of term frequency occurrences in documents. The fitted model can be used to estimate the similarity between documents as well as between a set of specified keywords using an additional layer of latent variables which are referred to as topics. The R package topicmodels provides basic infrastructure for fitting topic models based on data structures from the text mining package tm. The package includes interfaces to two algorithms for fitting topic models: the variational expectation-maximization algorithm provided by David M. Blei and co-authors and an algorithm using Gibbs sampling by Xuan-Hieu Phan and co-authors.","The R package FAMT (factor analysis for multiple testing) provides a powerful method for large-scale significance testing under dependence. It is especially designed to select differentially expressed genes in microarray data when the correlation structure among gene expressions is strong. Indeed, this method reduces the negative impact of dependence on the multiple testing procedures by modeling the common information shared by all the variables using a factor analysis structure. New test statistics for general linear contrasts are deduced, taking advantage of the common factor structure to reduce correlation and consequently the variance of error rates. Thus, the FAMT method shows improvements with respect to most of the usual methods regarding the non discovery rate and the control of the false discovery rate (FDR).\nThe steps of this procedure, each of them corresponding to R functions, are illustrated in this paper by two microarray data analyses. We first present how to import the gene ex- pression data, the covariates and gene annotations. The second step includes the choice of the optimal number of factors, the factor model fitting, and provides a list of selected genes according to a preset FDR control level. Finally, diagnostic plots are provided to help the user interpret the factors using available external information on either genes or arrays.","In this paper we review the state space approach to time series analysis and establish the notation that is adopted in this special volume of the Journal of Statistical Software. We first provide some background on the history of state space methods for the analysis of time series. This is followed by a concise overview of linear Gaussian state space analysis including the modelling framework and appropriate estimation methods. We discuss the important class of unobserved component models which incorporate a trend, a seasonal, a cycle, and fixed explanatory and intervention variables for the univariate and multivariate analysis of time series. We continue the discussion by presenting methods for the computation of different estimates for the unobserved state vector: filtering, prediction, and smoothing. Estimation approaches for the other parameters in the model are also considered. Next, we discuss how the estimation procedures can be used for constructing confidence intervals, detecting outlier observations and structural breaks, and testing model assumptions of residual independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. We then show how ARIMA and ARIMA components models fit in the state space framework to time series analysis. We also provide a basic introduction for non-Gaussian state space models. Finally, we present an overview of the software tools currently available for the analysis of time series with state space methods as they are discussed in the other contributions to this special volume.","This paper reviews the use of STAMP (Structural Time Series Analyser, Modeler and Predictor) for modeling time series data using state-space methods with unobserved components. STAMP is a commercial, GUI-based program that runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh computers as part of the larger OxMetrics System. STAMP can estimate a wide-variety of both univariate and multivariate state-space models, provides a wide array of diagnostics, and has a batch mode capability. The use of STAMP is illustrated for the Nile river data which is analyzed throughout this issue, as well as by modeling a variety of oceanographic and climate related data sets. The analyses of the oceanographic and climate data illustrate the breadth of models available in STAMP, and that state-space methods produce results that provide new insights into important scientific problems.","The use of state space models and their inference is illustrated using the package SsfPack for Ox. After a rather long introduction that explains the use of SsfPack and many of its functions, four case-studies illustrate the practical implementation of the software to real world problems through short sample programs.\nThe first case consists in the analysis of the well-known (at least to time series analysis experts) Nile data with a local level model. The other case-studies deal with ARIMA and RegARIMA models applied to the (also well-known) Airline time series, structural time series models applied to the Italian industrial production index and stochastic volatility models applied to the FTSE100 index. In all applications inference on the model (hyper-) parameters is carried out by maximum likelihood, but in one case (stochastic volatility) also an MCMC-based approach is illustrated. Cubic splines are covered in a very short example as well.","We give an overview of some of the software tools available in R, either as built- in functions or contributed packages, for the analysis of state space models. Several illustrative examples are included, covering constant and time-varying models for both univariate and multivariate time series. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods to obtain parameter estimates are considered.","This paper presents two illustrations of state space modeling in S-PLUS using the SsfPack 3.0 routines implemented in S+FinMetrics 3.0. The state space modeling functions in S+FinMetrics/SsfPack are extremely flexible and powerful and can be used for a wide variety of linear Gaussian state space models and for some non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models.","State Space Models (SSM) is a MATLAB toolbox for time series analysis by state space methods. The software features fully interactive construction and combination of models, with support for univariate and multivariate models, complex time-varying (dy- namic) models, non-Gaussian models, and various standard models such as ARIMA and structural time-series models. The software includes standard functions for Kalman fil- tering and smoothing, simulation smoothing, likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, signal extraction and forecasting, with incorporation of exact initialization for filters and smoothers, and support for missing observations and multiple time series input with com- mon analysis structure. The software also includes implementations of TRAMO model selection and Hillmer-Tiao decomposition for ARIMA models. The software will provide a general toolbox for time series analysis on the MATLAB platform, allowing users to take advantage of its readily available graph plotting and general matrix computation capabilities.","RegComponent models are time series models with linear regression mean functions and error terms that follow ARIMA (autoregressive-integrated-moving average) component time series models. Bell (2004) discusses these models and gives some underlying theoretical and computational results. The REGCMPNT program is a Fortran program for performing Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation, signal extraction, and forecasting with RegComponent models. In this paper we briefly examine the nature of RegComponent models, provide an overview of the REGCMPNT program, and then use three examples to show some important features of the program and to illustrate its application to various different RegComponent models.","This paper uses several examples to show how the econometrics program RATS can be used to analyze state space models. It demonstrates Kalman filtering and smoothing, estimation of hyperparameters, unconditional and conditional simulation. It also provides a more complicated example where a dynamic simultaneous equations model is transformed into a proper state space representation and its unknown parameters are estimated.","We illustrate how to estimate parameters of linear state-space models using the Stata program sspace. We provide examples of how to use sspace to estimate the parameters of unobserved-component models, vector autoregressive moving-average models, and dynamic-factor models. We also show how to compute one-step, filtered, and smoothed estimates of the series and the states; dynamic forecasts and their confidence intervals; and residuals.","gretl is a general-purpose econometric package, whose most important characteristic is being free software. This ensures that its source code is freely available under the general public license (GPL) and, like most GPL software, that it can be used free of charge. As of version 1.8.1 (released in May 2009), it offers a mechanism for handling linear state space models in a reasonably general and efficient way. This article illustrates its main features with two examples.","This article provides a brief introduction to the state space modeling capabilities in SAS, a well-known statistical software system. SAS provides state space modeling in a few different settings. SAS/ETS, the econometric and time series analysis module of the SAS system, contains many procedures that use state space models to analyze univariate and multivariate time series data. In addition, SAS/IML, an interactive matrix language in the SAS system, provides Kalman filtering and smoothing routines for stationary and nonstationary state space models. SAS/IML also provides support for linear algebra and nonlinear function optimization, which makes it a convenient environment for general-purpose state space modeling.","This article details a Bayesian analysis of the Nile river flow data, using a similar state space model as other articles in this volume. For this data set, Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithms are implemented in the programming language Ox. These Markov chain Monte Carlo methods only provide output conditioned upon the full data set. For filtered output, conditioning only on past observations, the particle filter is introduced. The sampling methods are flexible, and this advantage is used to extend the model to incorporate a stochastic volatility process. The volatility changes both in the Nile data and also in daily S&P 500 return data are investigated. The posterior density of parameters and states is found to provide information on which elements of the model are easily identifiable, and which elements are estimated with less precision.","This special volume of the Journal of Statistical Software on political methodology includes 14 papers, with wide-ranging software contributions of political scientists to their own field, and more generally to statistical data analysis in the the social sciences and beyond. Special emphasis is given to software that is written in or can cooperate with the R system for statistical computing.","We identify principles and practices for writing and publishing statistical software with maximum benefit to the scholarly community.","When respondents use the ordinal response categories of standard survey questions in different ways, the validity of analyses based on the resulting data can be biased. Anchoring vignettes is a survey design technique intended to correct for some of these problems. The anchors package in R includes methods for evaluating and choosing anchoring vignettes, and for analyzing the resulting data.","BARD is the first (and at time of writing, only) open source software package for general redistricting and redistricting analysis. BARD provides methods to create, display, compare, edit, automatically refine, evaluate, and profile political districting plans. BARD aims to provide a framework for scientific analysis of redistricting plans and to facilitate wider public participation in the creation of new plans.\n\nBARD facilitates map creation and refinement through command-line, graphical user interface, and automatic methods. Since redistricting is a computationally complex partitioning problem not amenable to an exact optimization solution, BARD implements a variety of selectable metaheuristics that can be used to refine existing or randomly-generated redistricting plans based on user-determined criteria.\n\nFurthermore, BARD supports automated generation of redistricting plans and profiling of plans by assigning different weights to various criteria, such as district compactness or equality of population. This functionality permits exploration of trade-offs among criteria. The intent of a redistricting authority may be explored by examining these trade-offs and inferring which reasonably observable plans were not adopted.\n\nRedistricting is a computationally-intensive problem for even modest-sized states. Performance is thus an important consideration in BARD's design and implementation. The program implements performance enhancements such as evaluation caching, explicit memory management, and distributed computing across snow clusters.","eco is a publicly available R package that implements the Bayesian and likelihood methods proposed in Imai, Lu, and Strauss (2008b)  for ecological inference in 2 X 2 tables as well as the method of bounds introduced by  (Duncan and Davis 1953). The package fits both parametric and nonparametric models using either the Expectation-Maximization algorithms (for likelihood models) or the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms (for Bayesian models). For all models, the individual-level data can be directly incorporated into the estimation whenever such data are available. Along with in-sample and out-of-sample predictions, the package also provides a functionality which allows one to quantify the effect of data aggregation on parameter estimation and hypothesis testing under the parametric likelihood models. This paper illustrates the usage of eco with several real data examples that are also part of the package.","IndElec is a software addressed to compute a wide range of indices from electoral data, which are intended to analyze both party systems and electoral systems in political studies. Further, IndElec can calculate such indices from electoral data at several levels of aggregation, even when the acronyms of some political parties change across districts. As the amount of information provided by IndElec may be considerable, this software also aids the user in the analysis of electoral data through three capabilities. First, IndElec automatically elaborates preliminary descriptive statistical reports of computed indices. Second, IndElec saves the computed information into text files in data matrix format, which can be directly loaded by any statistical software to facilitate more sophisticated statistical studies. Third, IndElec provides results in several file formats (text, CSV, HTML, R) to facilitate their visualization and management by using a wide range of application softwares (word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers, etc.). Finally, a graphical user interface is provided for IndElec to manage calculation processes, but no visualization facility is available in this environment. In fact, both the inputs and outputs for IndElec are arranged in files with the aforementioned formats.","Matching is an R package which provides functions for multivariate and propensity score matching and for finding optimal covariate balance based on a genetic search algorithm. A variety of univariate and multivariate metrics to determine if balance actually has been obtained are provided. The underlying matching algorithm is written in C++, makes extensive use of system BLAS and scales efficiently with dataset size. The genetic algorithm which finds optimal balance is parallelized and can make use of multiple CPUs or a cluster of computers. A large number of options are provided which control exactly how the matching is conducted and how balance is evaluated.","MatchIt implements the suggestions of Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart (2007) for improving parametric statistical models by preprocessing data with nonparametric matching methods. MatchIt implements a wide range of sophisticated matching methods, making it possible to greatly reduce the dependence of causal inferences on hard-to-justify, but commonly made, statistical modeling assumptions. The software also easily fits into existing research practices since, after preprocessing data with MatchIt, researchers can use whatever parametric model they would have used without MatchIt, but produce inferences with substantially more robustness and less sensitivity to modeling assumptions. MatchIt is an R program, and also works seamlessly with Zelig.","We introduce MCMCpack, an R package that contains functions to perform Bayesian inference using posterior simulation for a number of statistical models. In addition to code that can be used to fit commonly used models, MCMCpack also contains some useful utility functions, including some additional density functions and pseudo-random number generators for statistical distributions, a general purpose Metropolis sampling algorithm, and tools for visualization.","poLCA is a software package for the estimation of latent class and latent class regression models for polytomous outcome variables, implemented in the R statistical computing environment. Both models can be called using a single simple command line. The basic latent class model is a finite mixture model in which the component distributions are assumed to be multi-way cross-classification tables with all variables mutually independent. The latent class regression model further enables the researcher to estimate the effects of covariates on predicting latent class membership. poLCA uses expectation-maximization and Newton-Raphson algorithms to find maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.","genoud is an R function that combines evolutionary algorithm methods with a derivative-based (quasi-Newton) method to solve difficult optimization problems. genoud may also be used for optimization problems for which derivatives do not exist. genoud solves problems that are nonlinear or perhaps even discontinuous in the parameters of the function to be optimized. When the function to be optimized (for example, a log-likelihood) is nonlinear in the model's parameters, the function will generally not be globally concave and may have irregularities such as saddlepoints or discontinuities. Optimization methods that rely on derivatives of the objective function may be unable to find any optimum at all. Multiple local optima may exist, so that there is no guarantee that a derivative-based method will converge to the global optimum. On the other hand, algorithms that do not use derivative information (such as pure genetic algorithms) are for many problems needlessly poor at local hill climbing. Most statistical problems are regular in a neighborhood of the solution. Therefore, for some portion of the search space, derivative information is useful. The function supports parallel processing on multiple CPUs on a single machine or a cluster of computers.","The Scythe Statistical Library is an open source C++ library for statistical computation. It includes a suite of matrix manipulation functions, a suite of pseudo-random number generators, and a suite of numerical optimization routines. Programs written using Scythe are generally much faster than those written in commonly used interpreted languages, such as R and proglang{MATLAB}; and can be compiled on any system with the GNU GCC compiler (and perhaps with other C++ compilers). One of the primary design goals of the Scythe developers has been ease of use for non-expert C++ programmers. Ease of use is provided through three primary mechanisms: (1) operator and function over-loading, (2) numerous pre-fabricated utility functions, and (3) clear documentation and example programs. Additionally, Scythe is quite flexible and entirely extensible because the source code is available to all users under the GNU General Public License.","The R package Synth implements synthetic control methods for comparative case studies designed to estimate the causal effects of policy interventions and other events of interest (Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010). These techniques are particularly well-suited to investigate events occurring at an aggregate level (i.e., countries, cities, regions, etc.) and affecting a relatively small number of units. Benefits and features of the Synth package are illustrated using data from Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), which examined the economic impact of the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country.","This paper presents a software package designed to estimate Poole and Rosenthal W-NOMINATE scores in R. The package uses a logistic regression model to analyze political choice data, usually (though not exclusively) from a legislative setting. In contrast to other scaling methods, W-NOMINATE explicitly assumes probabilistic voting based on a spatial utility function, where the parameters of the utility function and the spatial coordinates of the legislators and the votes can all be estimated on the basis of observed voting behavior. Building on software written by Poole in Fortran, the new wnominate package in R facilitates easier data input and manipulation, generates bootstrapped standard errors, and includes a new suite of graphics functions to display the results. We demonstrate the functionality of this package by conducting a natural experiment using roll calls -- an experiment which is greatly simplified by the data manipulation capabilities of the wnominate package in R.","The bayesTFR package for R provides a set of functions to produce probabilistic projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. In the model, a random walk with drift is used to project the TFR during the fertility transition, using a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the parameters of the drift term. The TFR is modeled with a first order autoregressive process during the post-transition phase. The computationally intensive part of the projection model is a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating the parameters of the drift term. This article summarizes the projection model and describes the basic steps to generate probabilistic projections, as well as other functionalities such as projecting aggregate outcomes and dealing with missing values.","A primary issue in industrial hygiene is the estimation of a worker's exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents. Mathematical modeling is increasingly being used as a method for assessing occupational exposures. However, predicting exposure in real settings is constrained by lack of quantitative knowledge of exposure determinants. Recently,  Zhang, Banerjee, Yang, Lungu, and Ramachandran (2009) proposed Bayesian hierarchical models for estimating parameters and exposure concentrations for the two-zone differential equation models and for predicting concentrations in a zone near and far away from the source of contamination.\n\nBayesian estimation, however, can often require substantial amounts of user-defined code and tuning. In this paper, we introduce a statistical software package, B2Z, built upon the R statistical computing platform that implements a Bayesian model for estimating model parameters and exposure concentrations in two-zone models. We discuss the algorithms behind our package and illustrate its use with simulated and real data examples.","Locally stationary process representations have recently been proposed and applied to both time series and image analysis applications. This article describes an implementation of the locally stationary two-dimensional wavelet process approach in R. This package permits construction of estimates of spatially localized spectra and localized autocovariance which can be used to characterize structure within images.","Research and development on atmospheric and topographic correction methods for multispectral satellite data such as Landsat images has far outpaced the availability of those methods in geographic information systems software. As Landsat and other data become more widely available, demand for these improved correction methods will increase. Open source R statistical software can help bridge the gap between research and implementation. Sophisticated spatial data routines are already available, and the ease of program development in R makes it straightforward to implement new correction algorithms and to assess the results. Collecting radiometric, atmospheric, and topographic correction routines into the landsat package will make them readily available for evaluation for particular applications.","In the paper we present an R package MNM dedicated to multivariate data analysis based on the L1 norm. The analysis proceeds very much as does a traditional multivariate analysis. The regular L2 norm is just replaced by different L1 norms, observation vectors are replaced by their (standardized and centered) spatial signs, spatial ranks, and spatial signed-ranks, and so on. The procedures are fairly efficient and robust, and no moment assumptions are needed for asymptotic approximations. The background theory is briefly explained in the multivariate linear regression model case, and the use of the package is illustrated with several examples using the R package MNM.","Multilevel acceptance sampling for attributes is used to decide whether a lot from an incoming shipment or outgoing production is accepted or rejected when the product has multiple levels of product quality or multiple types of (mutually exclusive) possible defects. This paper describes a package which provides the tools to create, evaluate, plot, and display the acceptance sampling plans for such lots for both fixed and sequential sampling. The functions for calculating cumulative probabilities for several common multivariate distributions (which are needed in the package) are provided as well.","The population attributable fraction (PAF) is a useful measure for quantifying the impact of exposure to certain risk factors on a particular outcome at the population level. Recently, new model-based methods for the estimation of PAF and its confidence interval for different types of outcomes in a cohort study design have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce SAS macros implementing these methods and illustrate their application with a data example on the impact of different risk factors on type 2 diabetes incidence.","Distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs) represent a modeling framework to flexibly describe associations showing potentially non-linear and delayed effects in time series data. This methodology rests on the definition of a crossbasis, a bi-dimensional functional space expressed by the combination of two sets of basis functions, which specify the relationships in the dimensions of predictor and lags, respectively. This framework is implemented in the R package dlnm, which provides functions to perform the broad range of models within the DLNM family and then to help interpret the results, with an emphasis on graphical representation. This paper offers an overview of the capabilities of the package, describing the conceptual and practical steps to specify and interpret DLNMs with an example of application to real data.","R users can often solve optimization tasks easily using the tools in the optim function in the stats package provided by default on R installations. However, there are many other optimization and nonlinear modelling tools in R or in easily installed add-on packages. These present users with a bewildering array of choices. optimx is a wrapper to consolidate many of these choices for the optimization of functions that are mostly smooth with parameters at most bounds-constrained. We attempt to provide some diagnostic information about the function, its scaling and parameter bounds, and the solution characteristics. optimx runs a battery of methods on a given problem, thus facilitating comparative studies of optimization algorithms for the problem at hand. optimx can also be a useful pedagogical tool for demonstrating the strengths and pitfalls of different classes of optimization approaches including Newton, gradient, and derivative-free methods.","Ecological research uses data collection techniques that are prone to substantial and unique types of measurement error to address scientific questions about species abundance and distribution. These data collection schemes include a number of survey methods in which unmarked individuals are counted, or determined to be present, at spatially- referenced sites. Examples include site occupancy sampling, repeated counts, distance sampling, removal sampling, and double observer sampling. To appropriately analyze these data, hierarchical models have been developed to separately model explanatory variables of both a latent abundance or occurrence process and a conditional detection process. Because these models have a straightforward interpretation paralleling mechanisms under which the data arose, they have recently gained immense popularity. The common hierarchical structure of these models is well-suited for a unified modeling interface. The R package unmarked provides such a unified modeling framework, including tools for data exploration, model fitting, model criticism, post-hoc analysis, and model comparison.","The two-phase design has recently received attention in the statistical literature as an extension to the traditional case-control study for settings where a predictor of interest is rare or subject to missclassification. Despite a thorough methodological treatment and the potential for substantial efficiency gains, the two-phase design has not been widely adopted. This may be due, in part, to a lack of general-purpose, readily-available software. The osDesign package for R provides a suite of functions for analyzing data from a two-phase and/or case-control design, as well as evaluating operating characteristics, including bias, efficiency and power. The evaluation is simulation-based, permitting flexible application of the package to a broad range of scientific settings. Using lung cancer mortality data from Ohio, the package is illustrated with a detailed case-study in which two statistical goals are considered: (i) the evaluation of small-sample operating characteristics for two-phase and case-control designs and (ii) the planning and design of a future two-phase study.","SamplerCompare is an R package for comparing the performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. It samples from a collection of distributions with a collection of MCMC methods over a range of tuning parameters. Then, using log density evaluations per uncorrelated observation as a figure of merit, it generates a grid of plots showing the results of the simulation. It comes with a collection of predefined distributions and samplers and provides R and C interfaces for defining additional ones. It also provides the means to import simulation data generated by external systems. This document provides background on the package and demonstrates the basics of running simulations, visualizing results, and defining distributions and samplers in R.","We describe the R package ipw for estimating inverse probability weights. We show how to use the package to fit marginal structural models through inverse probability weighting, to estimate causal effects. Our package can be used with data from a point treatment situation as well as with a time-varying exposure and time-varying confounders. It can be used with binomial, categorical, ordinal and continuous exposure variables.","The R package spikeSlabGAM implements Bayesian variable selection, model choice, and regularized estimation in (geo-)additive mixed models for Gaussian, binomial, and Poisson responses. Its purpose is to (1) choose an appropriate subset of potential covariates and their interactions, (2) to determine whether linear or more flexible functional forms are required to model the effects of the respective covariates, and (3) to estimate their shapes. Selection and regularization of the model terms is based on a novel spike-and-slab-type prior on coefficient groups associated with parametric and semi-parametric effects.","A common feature of many magnetic resonance image (MRI) data processing methods is the voxel-by-voxel (a voxel is a volume element) manner in which the processing is performed. In general, however, MRI data are expected to exhibit some level of spatial correlation, rendering an independent-voxels treatment inefficient in its use of the data. Bayesian random effect models are expected to be more efficient owing to their information-borrowing behaviour.\nTo illustrate the Bayesian random effects approach, this paper outlines a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of a perfusion MRI dataset, implemented in R using the BRugs package. BRugs provides an interface to WinBUGS and its GeoBUGS add-on. WinBUGS is a widely used programme for performing MCMC analyses, with a focus on Bayesian random effect models. A simultaneous modeling of both voxels (restricted to a region of interest) and multiple subjects is demonstrated. Despite the low signal-to-noise ratio in the magnetic resonance signal intensity data, useful model signal intensity profiles are obtained. The merits of random effects modeling are discussed in comparison with the alternative approaches based on region-of-interest averaging and repeated independent voxels analysis.\nThis paper focuses on perfusion MRI for the purpose of illustration, the main proposition being that random effects modeling is expected to be beneficial in many other MRI applications in which the signal-to-noise ratio is a limiting factor.","Numerical deconvolution is a powerful mathematical operation that can be used to extract the impulse response function of a linear, time-invariant system. We have found this method to be useful for preliminary analysis of dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data, capable of quickly producing voxel-wise parametric maps describing the heterogeneity of contrast agent kinetics over the entire field of view, typically comprising tens of thousands of voxels. The statistical programming language R is well suited for this type of analysis and when combined with LATEX, via Sweave, allows one to perform all calculations and generate a report with a single script. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the R package DATforDCEMRI, a Deconvolution Analysis Tool for DCE-MRI contrast agent concentration vs. time data, which allows the user to perform kinetic deconvolution analysis and visualize/explore the resulting voxel-wise parametric maps and associated data.","Graphic processing units (GPUs) are rapidly gaining maturity as powerful general parallel computing devices. A key feature in the development of modern GPUs has been the advancement of the programming model and programming tools. Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a software platform for massively parallel high-performance computing on Nvidia many-core GPUs. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the volume of the data to be processed, and the type of statistical analysis to perform call for high-performance computing strategies. In this work, we present the main features of the R-CUDA package cudaBayesreg which implements in CUDA the core of a Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain fMRI data. The statistical model implements a Gibbs sampler for multilevel/hierarchical linear models with a normal prior. The main contribution for the increased performance comes from the use of separate threads for fitting the linear regression model at each voxel in parallel. The R-CUDA implementation of the Bayesian model proposed here has been able to reduce significantly the run-time processing of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations used in Bayesian fMRI data analyses. Presently, cudaBayesreg is only configured for Linux systems with Nvidia CUDA support.","The package dcemriS4 provides a complete set of data analysis tools for quantitative assessment of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Image processing is provided for the ANALYZE and NIfTI data formats as input with all parameter estimates being output in NIfTI format. Estimation of T1 relaxation from multiple flip-angle acquisitions, using either constant or spatially-varying flip angles, is performed via nonlinear regression. Both literature-based and data-driven arterial input functions are available and may be combined with a variety of compartmental models. Kinetic parameters are obtained from nonlinear regression, Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo or Bayesian maximum a posteriori estimation. A non-parametric model, using penalized splines, is also available to characterize the contrast agent concentration time curves. Estimation of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is provided for diffusion-weighted imaging. Given the size of multi-dimensional data sets commonly acquired in imaging studies, care has been taken to maximize computational efficiency and minimize memory usage. All methods are illustrated using both simulated and real-world medical imaging data available in the public domain.","This paper presents an R package for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tissue classification. The methods include using normal mixture models, hidden Markov normal mixture models, and a higher resolution hidden Markov normal mixture model fitted by various optimization algorithms and by a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Functions to obtain initial values of parameters of normal mixture models and spatial parameters are provided. Supported input formats are ANALYZE, NIfTI, and a raw byte format. The function slices3d in misc3d is used for visualizing data and results. Various performance evaluation indices are provided to evaluate classification results. To improve performance, table lookup methods are used in several places, and vectorized computation taking advantage of conditional independence properties are used. Some computations are performed by C code, and OpenMP is used to parallelize key loops in the C code.","For statistical analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data sets, we propose a data-driven approach based on independent component analysis (ICA) implemented in a new version of the AnalyzeFMRI R package. For fMRI data sets, spatial dimension being much greater than temporal dimension, spatial ICA is the computationally tractable approach generally proposed. However, for some neuroscientific applications, temporal independence of source signals can be assumed and temporal ICA becomes then an attractive exploratory technique. In this work, we use a classical linear algebra result ensuring the tractability of temporal ICA. We report several experiments on synthetic data and real MRI data sets that demonstrate the potential interest of our R package.","Studies that validate statistical methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data often use simulated data to ensure that the ground truth is known. However, simulated fMRI data are almost always generated using in-house procedures because a well-accepted simulation method is lacking. In this article we describe the R package neuRosim, which is a collection of data generation functions for neuroimaging data. We will demonstrate the possibilities to generate data from simple time series to complete 4D images and the possibilities for the user to create her own data generation method.","The purpose of the package fmri is the analysis of single subject functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. It provides fMRI analysis from time series modeling by a linear model to signal detection and publication quality images. Specifically, it implements structural adaptive smoothing methods with signal detection for adaptive noise reduction which avoids blurring of activation areas.\nWithin this paper we describe the complete pipeline for fMRI analysis using fmri. We describe data reading from various medical imaging formats and the linear modeling used to create the statistical parametric maps. We review the rationale behind the structural adaptive smoothing algorithms and explain their usage from the package fmri. We demonstrate the results of such analysis using two experimental datasets. Finally, we report on the usage of a graphical user interface for some of the package functions.","Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a magnetic resonance (MR) based method to investigate water diffusion in tissue like the human brain. Inference focuses on integral properties of the tissue microstructure. The acquired data are usually modeled using the diffusion tensor model, a three-dimensional Gaussian model for the diffusion process. Since the homogeneity assumption behind this model is not valid in large portion of the brain voxel more sophisticated approaches have been developed.\nThis paper describes the R package dti. The package offers capabilities for the analysis of diffusion weighted MR experiments. Here, we focus on recent extensions of the package, for example models for high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (HARDI) data, including Q-ball imaging and tensor mixture models, and fiber tracking. We provide a detailed description of the package structure and functionality. Examples are used to guide the reader through a typical analysis using the package. Data sets and R scripts used are available as electronic supplements.","Functional integration in the brain refers to distributed interactions among functionally segregated regions. Investigation of effective connectivity in brain networks, i.e, the directed causal influence that one brain region exerts over another region, is being increasingly recognized as an important tool for understanding brain function in neuroimaging studies. Methods for identifying intrinsic relationships among elements in a network are increasingly in demand.\nOver the last few decades several techniques such as Bayesian networks, Granger causality, and dynamic causal models have been developed to identify causal relations in dynamic systems. At the same time, established techniques such as structural equation modeling (SEM) are being modified and extended in order to reveal underlying interactions in imaging data. In the R package FIAR, which stands for Functional Integration Analysis in R, we have implemented many of the latest techniques for analyzing brain networks based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The package can be used to analyze experimental data, but also to simulate data under certain models.","In standard fMRI analysis all voxels are tested in a massive univariate approach, that is, each voxel is tested independently. This requires stringent corrections for multiple comparisons to control the number of false positive tests (i.e., marking voxels as active while they are actually not). As a result, fMRI analyses may suffer from low power to detect activation, especially in studies with high levels of noise in the data, for example developmental or single-subject studies. Activated region fitting (ARF) yields a solution by modeling fMRI data by multiple Gaussian shaped regions. ARF only requires a small number of parameters and therefore has increased power to detect activation. If required, the estimated regions can be directly used as regions of interest in a functional connectivity analysis. ARF is implemented in the R package arf3DS4. In this paper ARF and its implementation are described and illustrated with an example.","Owing to its practicality as well as strong inferential properties, multiple imputation has been increasingly popular in the analysis of incomplete data. Methods that are not only computationally elegant but also applicable in wide spectrum of statistical incomplete data problems have also been increasingly implemented in a numerous computing environments. Unfortunately, however, the speed of this development has not been replicated in reaching to \"sophisticated\" users. While the researchers have been quite successful in developing the underlying software, documentation in a style that would be most reachable to the greater scientific society has been lacking. The main goal of this special volume is to close this gap by articles that illustrate these software developments. Here I provide a brief history of multiple imputation and relevant software and highlight the contents of the contributions. Potential directions for the future of the software development is also provided.","Our mi package in R has several features that allow the user to get inside the imputation process and evaluate the reasonableness of the resulting models and imputations. These features include: choice of predictors, models, and transformations for chained imputation models; standard and binned residual plots for checking the fit of the conditional distributions used for imputation; and plots for comparing the distributions of observed and imputed data. In addition, we use Bayesian models and weakly informative prior distributions to construct more stable estimates of imputation models. Our goal is to have a demonstration package that (a) avoids many of the practical problems that arise with existing multivariate imputation programs, and (b) demonstrates state-of-the-art diagnostics that can be applied more generally and can be incorporated into the software of others.","The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.","Missing data are a common occurrence in real datasets. For epidemiological and prognostic factors studies in medicine, multiple imputation is becoming the standard route to estimating models with missing covariate data under a missing-at-random assumption. We describe ice, an implementation in Stata of the MICE approach to multiple imputation. Real data from an observational study in ovarian cancer are used to illustrate the most important of the many options available with ice. We remark briefly on the new database architecture and procedures for multiple imputation introduced in releases 11 and 12 of Stata.","Multiple imputation is becoming increasingly established as the leading practical approach to modelling partially observed data, under the assumption that the data are missing at random. However, many medical and social datasets are multilevel, and this structure should be reflected not only in the model of interest, but also in the imputation model. In particular, the imputation model should reflect the differences between level 1 variables and level 2 variables (which are constant across level 1 units). This led us to develop the REALCOM-IMPUTE software, which we describe in this article. This software performs multilevel multiple imputation, and handles ordinal and unordered categorical data appropriately. It is freely available on-line, and may be used either as a standalone package, or in conjunction with the multilevel software MLwiN or Stata.","Multiple imputation provides a useful strategy for dealing with data sets that have missing values. Instead of filling in a single value for each missing value, a multiple imputation procedure replaces each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. These multiply imputed data sets are then analyzed by using standard procedures for complete data and combining the results from these analyses. No matter which complete-data analysis is used, the process of combining results of parameter estimates and their associated standard errors from different imputed data sets is essentially the same. This process results in valid statistical inferences that properly reflect the uncertainty due to missing values.\n\nThis paper reviews methods for analyzing missing data and applications of multiple imputation techniques. This paper presents the SAS/STAT MI and MIANALYZE procedures, which perform inference by multiple imputation under numerous settings. PROC MI implements popular methods for creating imputations under monotone and nonmonotone (arbitrary) patterns of missing data, and PROC MIANALYZE analyzes results from multiply imputed data sets.","Amelia II is a complete R package for multiple imputation of missing data. The package implements a new expectation-maximization with bootstrapping algorithm that works faster, with larger numbers of variables, and is far easier to use, than various Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches, but gives essentially the same answers. The program also improves imputation models by allowing researchers to put Bayesian priors on individual cell values, thereby including a great deal of potentially valuable and extensive information. It also includes features to accurately impute cross-sectional datasets, individual time series, or sets of time series for different cross-sections. A full set of graphical diagnostics are also available. The program is easy to use, and the simplicity of the algorithm makes it far more robust; both a simple command line and extensive graphical user interface are included.","This paper discusses a Fortran 90 program referred to as BIEMS (Bayesian inequality and equality constrained model selection) that can be used for calculating Bayes factors of multivariate normal linear models with equality and/or inequality constraints between the model parameters versus a model containing no constraints, which is referred to as the unconstrained model. The prior that is used under the unconstrained model is the conjugate expected-constrained posterior prior and the prior under the constrained model is proportional to the unconstrained prior truncated in the constrained space. This results in Bayes factors that appropriately balance between model fit and complexity for a broad class of constrained models. When the set of equality and/or inequality constraints in the model represents a hypothesis that applied researchers have in, for instance, (M)AN(C)OVA, (multivariate) regression, or repeated measurements, the obtained Bayes factor can be used to determine how much evidence is provided by the data in favor of the hypothesis in comparison to the unconstrained model. If several hypotheses are under investigation, the Bayes factors between the constrained models can be calculated using the obtained Bayes factors from BIEMS. Furthermore, posterior model probabilities of constrained models are provided which allows the user to compare the models directly with each other.","We present a new computing environment for authoring mixed natural and computer language documents. In this environment a single hierarchically-organized plain text source file may contain a variety of elements such as code in arbitrary programming languages, raw data, links to external resources, project management data, working notes, and text for publication. Code fragments may be executed in situ with graphical, numerical and textual output captured or linked in the file. Export to LATEX, HTML, LATEX beamer, DocBook and other formats permits working reports, presentations and manuscripts for publication to be generated from the file. In addition, functioning pure code files can be automatically extracted from the file. This environment is implemented as an extension to the Emacs text editor and provides a rich set of features for authoring both prose and code, as well as sophisticated project management capabilities.","Exploratory factor analysis is a widely used statistical technique in the social sciences. It attempts to identify underlying factors that explain the pattern of correlations within a set of observed variables. A statistical software package is needed to perform the calculations. However, there are some limitations with popular statistical software packages, like SPSS. The R programming language is a free software package for statistical and graphical computing. It offers many packages written by contributors from all over the world and programming resources that allow it to overcome the dialog limitations of SPSS. This paper offers an SPSS dialog written in the R programming language with the help of some packages, so that researchers with little or no knowledge in programming, or those who are accustomed to making their calculations based on statistical dialogs, have more options when applying factor analysis to their data and hence can adopt a better approach when dealing with ordinal, Likert-type data.","Setting the free parameters of classifiers to different values can have a profound impact on their performance. For some methods, specialized tuning algorithms have been developed. These approaches mostly tune parameters according to a single criterion, such as the cross-validation error. However, it is sometimes desirable to obtain parameter values that optimize several concurrent - often conflicting - criteria. The TunePareto package provides a general and highly customizable framework to select optimal parameters for classifiers according to multiple objectives. Several strategies for sampling and optimizing parameters are supplied. The algorithm determines a set of Pareto-optimal parameter configurations and leaves the ultimate decision on the weighting of objectives to the researcher. Decision support is provided by novel visualization techniques.","This paper presents the R package HDclassif which is devoted to the clustering and the discriminant analysis of high-dimensional data. The classification methods proposed in the package result from a new parametrization of the Gaussian mixture model which combines the idea of dimension reduction and model constraints on the covariance matrices. The supervised classification method using this parametrization is called high dimensional discriminant analysis (HDDA). In a similar manner, the associated clustering method is called high dimensional data clustering (HDDC) and uses the expectation-maximization algorithm for inference. In order to correctly fit the data, both methods estimate the specific subspace and the intrinsic dimension of the groups. Due to the constraints on the covariance matrices, the number of parameters to estimate is significantly lower than other model-based methods and this allows the methods to be stable and efficient in high dimensions. Two introductory examples illustrated with R codes allow the user to discover the hdda and hddc functions. Experiments on simulated and real datasets also compare HDDC and HDDA with existing classification methods on high-dimensional datasets. HDclassif is a free software and distributed under the general public license, as part of the R software project.","Neural networks are important standard machine learning procedures for classification and regression. We describe the R package RSNNS that provides a convenient interface to the popular Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator SNNS. The main features are (a) encapsulation of the relevant SNNS parts in a C++ class, for sequential and parallel usage of different networks, (b) accessibility of all of the SNNS algorithmic functionality from R using a low-level interface, and (c) a high-level interface for convenient, R-style usage of many standard neural network procedures. The package also includes functions for visualization and analysis of the models and the training procedures, as well as functions for data input/output from/to the original SNNS file formats.","A multivariate generalization of the emulator technique described by Hankin (2005) is presented in which random multivariate functions may be assessed. In the standard univariate case (Oakley 1999), a Gaussian process, a finite number of observations is made; here, observations of different types are considered. The technique has the property that marginal analysis (that is, considering only a single observation type) reduces exactly to the univariate theory. The associated software is used to analyze datasets from the field of climate change.","We present the R package bild for the parametric and graphical analysis of binary longitudinal data. The package performs logistic regression for binary longitudinal data, allowing for serial dependence among observations from a given individual and a random intercept term. Estimation is via maximization of the exact likelihood of a suitably defined model. Missing values and unbalanced data are allowed, with some restrictions. The code of bild is written partly in R language, partly in Fortran 77, interfaced through R. The package is built following the S4 formulation of R methods.","In this paper we present the R package gRain for propagation in graphical independence networks (for which Bayesian networks is a special instance). The paper includes a description of the theory behind the computations. The main part of the paper is an illustration of how to use the package. The paper also illustrates how to turn a graphical model and data into an independence network.","Many high-throughput biological data analyses require the calculation of large correlation matrices and/or clustering of a large number of objects. The standard R function for calculating Pearson correlation can handle calculations without missing values efficiently, but is inefficient when applied to data sets with a relatively small number of missing data. We present an implementation of Pearson correlation calculation that can lead to substantial speedup on data with relatively small number of missing entries. Further, we parallelize all calculations and thus achieve further speedup on systems where parallel processing is available. A robust correlation measure, the biweight midcorrelation, is implemented in a similar manner and provides comparable speed. The functions cor and bicor for fast Pearson and biweight midcorrelation, respectively, are part of the updated, freely available R package WGCNA.\nThe hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in R function hclust is an order n3 (n is the number of clustered objects) version of a publicly available clustering algorithm (Murtagh 2012). We present the package flashClust that implements the original algorithm which in practice achieves order approximately n2, leading to substantial time savings when clustering large data sets.","We present two natural generalizations of the multinomial and multivariate binomial distributions, which arise from the multiplicative binomial distribution of Altham (1978). The resulting two distributions are discussed and we introduce an R package, MM, which includes associated functionality.","This article describes the benchden package which implements a set of 28 example densities for nonparametric density estimation in R. In addition to the usual functions that evaluate the density, distribution and quantile functions or generate random variates, a function designed to be specifically useful for larger simulation studies has been added. After describing the set of densities and the usage of the package, a small toy example of a simulation study conducted using the benchden package is given.","splm is an R package for the estimation and testing of various spatial panel data specifications. We consider the implementation of both maximum likelihood and generalized moments estimators in the context of fixed as well as random effects spatial panel data models. This paper is a general description of splm and all functionalities are illustrated using a well-known example taken from Munnell (1990) with productivity data on 48 US states observed over 17 years. We perform comparisons with other available software; and, when this is not possible, Monte Carlo results support our original implementation.","Classical supervised learning enjoys the luxury of accessing the true known labels for the observations in a modeled dataset. Real life, however, poses an abundance of problems, where the labels are only partially defined, i.e., are uncertain and given only for a subset of observations. Such partial labels can occur regardless of the knowledge source. For example, an experimental assessment of labels may have limited capacity and is prone to measurement errors. Also expert knowledge is often restricted to a specialized area and is thus unlikely to provide trustworthy labels for all observations in the dataset. Partially supervised mixture modeling is able to process such sparse and imprecise input. Here, we present an R package called bgmm, which implements two partially supervised mixture modeling methods: soft-label and belief-based modeling. For completeness, we equipped the package also with the functionality of unsupervised, semi- and fully supervised mixture modeling. On real data we present the usage of bgmm for basic model-fitting in all modeling variants. The package can be applied also to selection of the best-fitting from a set of models with different component numbers or constraints on their structures. This functionality is presented on an artificial dataset, which can be simulated in bgmm from a distribution defined by a given model.","Frailty models are very useful for analysing correlated survival data, when observations are clustered into groups or for recurrent events. The aim of this article is to present the new version of an R package called frailtypack. This package allows to fit Cox models and four types of frailty models (shared, nested, joint, additive) that could be useful for several issues within biomedical research. It is well adapted to the analysis of recurrent events such as cancer relapses and/or terminal events (death or lost to follow-up). The approach uses maximum penalized likelihood estimation. Right-censored or left-truncated data are considered. It also allows stratification and time-dependent covariates during analysis.","The R package bclust is useful for clustering high-dimensional continuous data. The package uses a parametric spike-and-slab Bayesian model to downweight the effect of noise variables and to quantify the importance of each variable in agglomerative clustering. We take advantage of the existence of closed-form marginal distributions to estimate the model hyper-parameters using empirical Bayes, thereby yielding a fully automatic method. We discuss computational problems arising in implementation of the procedure and illustrate the usefulness of the package through examples.","We consider the problem of nonparametric density estimation where estimates are constrained to be unimodal. Though several methods have been proposed to achieve this end, each of them has its own drawbacks and none of them have readily-available computer codes. The approach of Braun and Hall (2001), where a kernel density estimator is modified by data sharpening, is one of the most promising options, but optimization difficulties make it hard to use in practice. This paper presents a new algorithm and MATLAB code for finding good unimodal density estimates under the Braun and Hall scheme. The algorithm uses a greedy, feasibility-preserving strategy to ensure that it always returns a unimodal solution. Compared to the incumbent method of optimization, the greedy method is easier to use, runs faster, and produces solutions of comparable quality. It can also be extended to the bivariate case.","Manufacturing processes are often based on more than one quality characteristic. When these variables are correlated the process capability analysis should be performed using multivariate statistical methodologies. Although there is a growing interest in methods for evaluating the capability of multivariate processes, little attention has been given to developing user friendly software for supporting multivariate capability analysis. In this work we introduce the package MPCI for R, which allows to compute multivariate process capability indices. MPCI aims to provide a useful tool for dealing with multivariate capability assessment problems. We illustrate the use of MPCI package through both simulated and real examples.","Aligment of mass spectrometry (MS) chromatograms is sometimes required prior to sample comparison and data analysis. Without alignment, direct comparison of chromatograms would lead to inaccurate results. We demonstrate a new method for computing a high quality alignment of full length MS chromatograms using variable penalty dynamic time warping. This method aligns signals using local linear shifts without excessive warping that can alter the shape (and area) of chromatogram peaks. The software is available as the R package VPdtw on the Comprehensive R Archive Network and we highlight how one can use this package here.","For survival data with a large number of explanatory variables, lasso penalized Cox regression is a popular regularization strategy. However, a penalized Cox model may not always provide the best fit to data and can be difficult to estimate in high dimension because of its intrinsic nonlinearity. The semiparametric additive hazards model is a flexible alternative which is a natural survival analogue of the standard linear regression model. Building on this analogy, we develop a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm for fitting the lasso and elastic net penalized additive hazards model. The algorithm requires no nonlinear optimization steps and offers excellent performance and stability. An implementation is available in the R package ahaz. We demonstrate this implementation in a small timing study and in an application to real data.","This paper introduces rpartScore (Galimberti, Soffritti, and Di Maso 2012), a new R package for building classification trees for ordinal responses, that can be employed whenever a set of scores is assigned to the ordered categories of the response. This package has been created to overcome some problems that produced unexpected results from the package rpartOrdinal (Archer 2010). Explanations for the causes of these unexpected results are provided. The main functionalities of rpartScore are described, and its use is illustrated through some examples.","This special volume features eleven contributions to psychometric computing, a research area that integrates psychometrics and computational methods in statistics. Topics covered include structural equation modeling, item response theory, probabilistic choice modeling, and other modeling approaches prevalent in or useful for psychometric research. Each contributed paper is accompanied by a software package published on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This introduction gives a brief overview of the volume.","Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a vast field and widely used by many applied researchers in the social and behavioral sciences. Over the years, many software packages for structural equation modeling have been developed, both free and commercial. However, perhaps the best state-of-the-art software packages in this field are still closed-source and/or commercial. The R package lavaan has been developed to provide applied researchers, teachers, and statisticians, a free, fully open-source, but commercial-quality package for latent variable modeling. This paper explains the aims behind the development of the package, gives an overview of its most important features, and provides some examples to illustrate how lavaan works in practice.","Structural equation models (SEM) are very popular in many disciplines. The partial least squares (PLS) approach to SEM offers an alternative to covariance-based SEM, which is especially suited for situations when data is not normally distributed. PLS path modelling is referred to as soft-modeling-technique with minimum demands regarding mea- surement scales, sample sizes and residual distributions. The semPLS package provides the capability to estimate PLS path models within the R programming environment. Different setups for the estimation of factor scores can be used. Furthermore it contains modular methods for computation of bootstrap confidence intervals, model parameters and several quality indices. Various plot functions help to evaluate the model. The well known mobile phone dataset from marketing research is used to demonstrate the features of the package.","We present the qgraph package for R, which provides an interface to visualize data through network modeling techniques. For instance, a correlation matrix can be represented as a network in which each variable is a node and each correlation an edge; by varying the width of the edges according to the magnitude of the correlation, the structure of the correlation matrix can be visualized. A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results. In this article, we introduce qgraph by applying the package functions to data from the NEO-PI-R, a widely used personality questionnaire.","Mokken (1971) developed a scaling procedure for both dichotomous and polytomous items that was later coined Mokken scale analysis (MSA). MSA has been developed ever since, and the developments until 2000 have been implemented in the software package MSP (Molenaar and Sijtsma 2000) and the R package mokken (Van der Ark 2007). This paper describes the new developments in MSA since 2000 that have been implemented in mokken since its first release in 2007. These new developments pertain to invariant item ordering, a new automated item selection procedure based on a genetic algorithm, inclusion of reliability coefficients, and the computation of standard errors for the scalability coefficients. We demonstrate all new applications using data obtained with a transitive reasoning test and a personality test.","Item response theory (IRT) is widely used in assessment and evaluation research to explain how participants respond to item level stimuli. Several R packages can be used to estimate the parameters in various IRT models, the most flexible being the ltm (Rizopoulos 2006), eRm (Mair and Hatzinger 2007), and MCMCpack (Martin, Quinn, and Park 2011) packages. However these packages have limitations in that ltm and eRm can only analyze unidimensional IRT models effectively and the exploratory multidimensional extensions available in MCMCpack requires prior understanding of Bayesian estimation convergence diagnostics and are computationally intensive. Most importantly, multidimensional confirmatory item factor analysis methods have not been implemented in any R package.\nThe mirt package was created for estimating multidimensional item response theory parameters for exploratory and confirmatory models by using maximum-likelihood meth- ods. The Gauss-Hermite quadrature method used in traditional EM estimation (e.g., Bock and Aitkin 1981) is presented for exploratory item response models as well as for confirmatory bifactor models (Gibbons and Hedeker 1992). Exploratory and confirmatory models are estimated by a stochastic algorithm described by Cai (2010a,b). Various program comparisons are presented and future directions for the package are discussed.","Measurement invariance is an important assumption in the Rasch model and mixture models constitute a flexible way of checking for a violation of this assumption by detecting unobserved heterogeneity in item response data. Here, a general class of Rasch mixture models is established and implemented in R, using conditional maximum likelihood estimation of the item parameters (given the raw scores) along with flexible specification of two model building blocks: (1) Mixture weights for the unobserved classes can be treated as model parameters or based on covariates in a concomitant variable model. (2) The distribution of raw score probabilities can be parametrized in two possible ways, either using a saturated model or a specification through mean and variance. The function raschmix() in the R package psychomix provides these models, leveraging the general infrastructure for fitting mixture models in the flexmix package. Usage of the function and its associated methods is illustrated on artificial data as well as empirical data from a study of verbally aggressive behavior.","This paper outlines a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) framework and presents an R package for the simulation of response patterns under CAT procedures. This package, called catR, requires a bank of items, previously calibrated according to the four-parameter logistic (4PL) model or any simpler logistic model. The package proposes several methods to select the early test items, several methods for next item selection, different estimators of ability (maximum likelihood, Bayes modal, expected a posteriori, weighted likelihood), and three stopping rules (based on the test length, the precision of ability estimates or the classification of the examinee). After a short description of the different steps of a CAT process, the commands and options of the catR package are presented and practically illustrated.","The first part of this paper describes a series of loglinear preference models based on paired comparisons, a method of measurement whose aim is to order a set of objects according to an attribute of interest by asking subjects to compare pairs of objects. Based on the basic Bradley-Terry specification, two types of models, the loglinear Bradley-Terry model and a pattern approach are presented. Both methods are extended to include subject and object-specific covariates and some further structural effects. In addition, models for derived paired comparisons (based on rankings and ratings) are also included. Latent classes and missing values can be included. The second part of the paper describes the package prefmod that implements the above models in R. Illustrational applications are provided in the last part of the paper.","Since R was first launched, it has managed to gain the support of an ever-increasing percentage of academic and professional statisticians. However, the spread of its use among novice and occasional users of statistics have not progressed at the same pace, which can be attributed partially to the lack of a graphical user interface (GUI). Nevertheless, this situation has changed in the last years and there is currently several projects that have added GUIs to R. This article discusses briefly the history of GUIs for data analysis and then introduces the papers submitted to an special issue of the Journal of Statistical Software on GUIs for R.","Degradation models are widely used to assess the lifetime information for highly reliable products with quality characteristics whose degradation over time can be related to reliability. The performance of a degradation model largely depends on an appropriate model description of the product's degradation path. The cross-platform package iDEMO (integrated degradation models) is developed in R and the interface is built using the Tcl/Tk bindings provided by the tcltk and tcltk2 packages included with R. It is a tool to build a linear degradation model which can simultaneously consider the unit-to-unit variation, time-dependent structure and measurement error in the degradation paths. The package iDEMO provides the maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown parameters, mean-time-to-failure and q-th quantile, and their corresponding confidence intervals based on the different information matrices. In addition, degradation model selection and goodness-of-fit tests are provided to determine and diagnose the degradation model for the user's current data by the commonly used criteria. By only enabling user interface elements when necessary, input errors are minimized.","In this work the software application called Glotaran is introduced as a Java-based graphical user interface to the R package TIMP, a problem solving environment for fitting superposition models to multi-dimensional data. TIMP uses a command-line user interface for the interaction with data, the specification of models and viewing of analysis results. Instead, Glotaran provides a graphical user interface which features interactive and dynamic data inspection, easier -- assisted by the user interface -- model specification and interactive viewing of results. The interactivity component is especially helpful when working with large, multi-dimensional datasets as often result from time-resolved spectroscopy measurements, allowing the user to easily pre-select and manipulate data before analysis and to quickly zoom in to regions of interest in the analysis results. Glotaran has been developed on top of the NetBeans rich client platform and communicates with R through the Java-to-R interface Rserve. The background and the functionality of the application are described here. In addition, the design, development and implementation process of Glotaran is documented in a generic way.","For many ecological analyses powerful statistical tools are required for a profound analysis of spatial and time based data sets. In order to avoid many common errors of analysis and data acquisition a graphical user interface can help to focus on the task of the analysis and minimize the time to fulfill certain tasks in a programming language like R. In this paper we present a graphical user interface for R embedded in the ecological modeling software Bio7 which is based on an Eclipse rich client platform. We demonstrate that within the Bio7 platform R can not only be effectively combined with Java but also with the powerful components of Eclipse. Additionally we present some custom Bio7 components which interact with R and make use of some useful advanced concepts and libraries of this connection. Our overview on the Bio7 R interface also emphasizes a broad applicability for disciplines beyond ecological modeling.","The R environment provides a natural platform for developing new statistical methods due to the mathematical expressiveness of the language, the large number of existing libraries, and the active developer community. One drawback to R, however, is the learning curve; programming is a deterrent to non-technical users, who typically prefer graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to command line environments. Thus, while statisticians develop new methods in R, practitioners are often behind in terms of the statistical techniques they use as they rely on GUI applications. Meta-analysis is an instructive example; cutting-edge meta-analysis methods are often ignored by the overwhelming majority of practitioners, in part because they have no easy way of applying them. This paper proposes a strategy to close the gap between the statistical state-of-the-science and what is applied in practice. We present open-source meta-analysis software that uses R as the underlying statistical engine, and Python for the GUI. We present a framework that allows methodologists to implement new methods in R that are then automatically integrated into the GUI for use by end-users, so long as the programmer conforms to our interface. Such an approach allows an intuitive interface for non-technical users while leveraging the latest advanced statistical methods implemented by methodologists.","This paper describes a graphical user interface (GUI) for the tourr package in R. The tour is a dynamic graphical method for viewing multivariate data. The GUI allows users to interact with a tour in order to explore the data for structures like clustering, outliers, nonlinear dependence. Users can pause the tour, choose a subset of variables, color points by other variables, and switch between several different types of tours.","The R Commander graphical user interface to R is extensible via plug-in packages, which integrate seamlessly with the R Commander's menu structure, data, and model handling. The paper describes the RcmdrPlugin.survival package, which makes many of the facilities of the survival package for R available through the R Commander, including Cox and parametric survival models. We explain the structure, capabilities, and limitations of this plug-in package and illustrate its use.","While R has proven itself to be a powerful and flexible tool for data exploration and analysis, it lacks the ease of use present in other software such as SPSS and Minitab. An easy to use graphical user interface (GUI) can help new users accomplish tasks that would otherwise be out of their reach, and improves the efficiency of expert users by replacing fifty key strokes with five mouse clicks. With this in mind, Deducer presents dialogs that are understandable for the beginner, and yet contain all (or most) of the options that an experienced statistician, performing the same task, would want. An Excel-like spreadsheet is included for easy data viewing and editing. Deducer is based on Java's Swing GUI library and can be used on any common operating system. The GUI is independent of the specific R console and can easily be used by calling a text-based menu system. Graphical menus are provided for the JGR console and the Windows R GUI.","R is a free open-source implementation of the S statistical computing language and programming environment. The current status of R is a command line driven interface with no advanced cross-platform graphical user interface (GUI), but it includes tools for building such. Over the past years, proprietary and non-proprietary GUI solutions have emerged, based on internal or external tool kits, with different scopes and technological concepts. For example, Rgui.exe and Rgui.app have become the de facto GUI on the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X platforms, respectively, for most users. In this paper we discuss RKWard which aims to be both a comprehensive GUI and an integrated development environment for R. RKWard is based on the KDE software libraries. Statistical procedures and plots are implemented using an extendable plugin architecture based on ECMAScript (JavaScript), R, and XML. RKWard provides an excellent tool to manage different types of data objects; even allowing for seamless editing of certain types. The objective of RKWard is to provide a portable and extensible R interface for both basic and advanced statistical and graphical analysis, while not compromising on flexibility and modularity of the R programming environment itself.","The gWidgetsWWW package provides a framework for easily developing interactive web pages from within R. It uses the API developed in the gWidgets programming interface to specify the layout of the controls and the relationships between them. The web pages may be served locally under R's built-in web server for help pages or from an rApache-enabled web server.","Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are gradually becoming more powerful and more accepted. They are the standard way of interacting with the web and play an increasing role in many software applications. Nevertheless, they have not been generally adopted, and critics point to particular weaknesses and disadvantages. Many of these are due more to flaws in design and implementation than to the basic concepts of GUIs. More attention could be paid to what users want to do and how a GUI might be developed to support these goals. Using a dataset about Oscar nominees and winners, this paper considers what analyses statisticians might carry out and what kind of GUI would be appropriate for these tasks. (It also offers some insights into the Oscars dataset.)","The MortalitySmooth package provides a framework for smoothing count data in both one- and two-dimensional settings. Although general in its purposes, the package is specifically tailored to demographers, actuaries, epidemiologists, and geneticists who may be interested in using a practical tool for smoothing mortality data over ages and/or years. The total number of deaths over a specified age- and year-interval is assumed to be Poisson-distributed, and P-splines and generalized linear array models are employed as a suitable regression methodology. Extra-Poisson variation can also be accommodated.","In many areas, scientists deal with increasingly high-dimensional data sets. An important aspect for these scientists is to gain a qualitative understanding of the process or system from which the data is gathered. Often, both input variables and an outcome are observed and the data can be characterized as a sample from a high-dimensional scalar function. This work presents the R package msr for exploratory data analysis of multivariate scalar functions based on the Morse-Smale complex. The Morse-Smale complex provides a topologically meaningful decomposition of the domain. The msr package implements a discrete approximation of the Morse-Smale complex for data sets. In previous work this approximation has been exploited for visualization and partition-based regression, which are both supported in the msr package. The visualization combines the Morse-Smale complex with dimension-reduction techniques for a visual summary representation that serves as a guide for interactive exploration of the high-dimensional function. In a similar fashion, the regression employs a combination of linear models based on the Morse-Smale decomposition of the domain. This regression approach yields topologically accurate estimates and facilitates interpretation of general trends and statistical comparisons between partitions. In this manner, the msr package supports high-dimensional data understanding and exploration through the Morse-Smale complex.","Analysis of covariance serves two important purposes in a randomized clinical trial. First, there is a reduction of variance for the treatment effect which provides more powerful statistical tests and more precise confidence intervals. Second, it provides estimates of the treatment effect which are adjusted for random imbalances of covariates between the treatment groups. The nonparametric analysis of covariance method of Koch, Tangen, Jung, and Amara (1998) defines a very general methodology using weighted least-squares to generate covariate-adjusted treatment effects with minimal assumptions. This methodology is general in its applicability to a variety of outcomes, whether continuous, binary, ordinal, incidence density or time-to-event. Further, its use has been illustrated in many clinical trial settings, such as multi-center, dose-response and non-inferiority trials.\n\nNParCov3 is a SAS/IML macro written to conduct the nonparametric randomization-based covariance analyses of Koch et al. (1998). The software can analyze a variety of outcomes and can account for stratification. Data from multiple clinical trials will be used for illustration.","We introduce an R package, bspmma, which implements a Dirichlet-based random effects model specific to meta-analysis. In meta-analysis, when combining effect estimates from several heterogeneous studies, it is common to use a random-effects model. The usual frequentist or Bayesian models specify a normal distribution for the true effects. However, in many situations, the effect distribution is not normal, e.g., it can have thick tails, be skewed, or be multi-modal. A Bayesian nonparametric model based on mixtures of Dirichlet process priors has been proposed in the literature, for the purpose of accommodating the non-normality. We review this model and then describe a competitor, a semiparametric version which has the feature that it allows for a well-defined centrality parameter convenient for determining whether the overall effect is significant. This second Bayesian model is based on a different version of the Dirichlet process prior, and we call it the \"conditional Dirichlet model\". The package contains functions to carry out analyses based on either the ordinary or the conditional Dirichlet model, functions for calculating certain Bayes factors that provide a check on the appropriateness of the conditional Dirichlet model, and functions that enable an empirical Bayes selection of the precision parameter of the Dirichlet process. We illustrate the use of the package on two examples, and give an interpretation of the results in these two different scenarios.","The optimization of a real-valued objective function f(U), where U is a p X d,p > d, semi-orthogonal matrix such that UTU=Id, and f is invariant under right orthogonal transformation of U, is often referred to as a Grassmann manifold optimization. Manifold optimization appears in a wide variety of computational problems in the applied sciences. In this article, we present GrassmannOptim, an R package for Grassmann manifold optimization. The implementation uses gradient-based algorithms and embeds a stochastic gradient method for global search. We describe the algorithms, provide some illustrative examples on the relevance of manifold optimization and finally, show some practical usages of the package.","dlmap is a software package capable of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a variety of genetic studies. Unlike most other QTL mapping packages, dlmap is built on a linear mixed model platform, and thus can simultaneously handle multiple sources of genetic and environmental variation. Furthermore, it can accommodate both experimental crosses and association mapping populations within a versatile modeling framework. The software implements a mapping algorithm with separate detection and localization stages in a user-friendly manner. It accepts data in various common formats, has a flexible modeling environment, and summarizes results both graphically and numerically.","Meta-analysis is a statistical method for combining information from different studies about the same issue of interest. Meta-analysis is widely diffuse in medical investigation and more recently it received a growing interest also in social disciplines. Typical applications involve a small number of studies, thus making ordinary inferential methods based on first-order asymptotics unreliable. More accurate results can be obtained by exploiting the theory of higher-order asymptotics. This paper describes the metaLik package which provides an R implementation of higher-order likelihood methods in meta-analysis. The extension to meta-regression is included. Two real data examples are used to illustrate the capabilities of the package.","The R package kerdiest has been designed for computing kernel estimators of the distribution function and other related functions. Because of its usefulness in real applications, the bandwidth parameter selection problem has been considered, and a cross-validation method and two of plug-in type have been implemented. Moreover, three relevant functions in nature hazards have also been programmed. The package is completed with two interesting data sets, one of geological type (a complete catalogue of the earthquakes occurring in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula) and another containing the maximum peak flow levels of a river in the United States of America.","The solaR package allows for reproducible research both for photovoltaics (PV) systems performance and solar radiation. It includes a set of classes, methods and functions to calculate the sun geometry and the solar radiation incident on a photovoltaic generator and to simulate the performance of several applications of the photovoltaic energy. This package performs the whole calculation procedure from both daily and intradaily global horizontal irradiation to the final productivity of grid-connected PV systems and water pumping PV systems.\n\nIt is designed using a set of S4 classes whose core is a group of slots with multivariate time series. The classes share a variety of methods to access the information and several visualization methods. In addition, the package provides a tool for the visual statistical analysis of the performance of a large PV plant composed of several systems.\n\nAlthough solaR is primarily designed for time series associated to a location defined by its latitude/longitude values and the temperature and irradiation conditions, it can be easily combined with spatial packages for space-time analysis.","Clustering text documents is a fundamental task in modern data analysis, requiring approaches which perform well both in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Spherical k-means clustering is one approach to address both issues, employing cosine dissimilarities to perform prototype-based partitioning of term weight representations of the documents.\n\nThis paper presents the theory underlying the standard spherical k-means problem and suitable extensions, and introduces the R extension package skmeans which provides a computational environment for spherical k-means clustering featuring several solvers: a fixed-point and genetic algorithm, and interfaces to two external solvers (CLUTO and Gmeans). Performance of these solvers is investigated by means of a large scale benchmark experiment.","Prediction error curves are increasingly used to assess and compare predictions in survival analysis. This article surveys the R package pec which provides a set of functions for efficient computation of prediction error curves. The software implements inverse probability of censoring weights to deal with right censored data and several variants of cross-validation to deal with the apparent error problem. In principle, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and the package readily supports most traditional regression modeling strategies, like Cox regression or additive hazard regression, as well as state of the art machine learning methods such as random forests, a nonparametric method which provides promising alternatives to traditional strategies in low and high-dimensional settings. We show how the functionality of pec can be extended to yet unsupported prediction models. As an example, we implement support for random forest prediction models based on the R packages randomSurvivalForest and party. Using data of the Copenhagen Stroke Study we use pec to compare random forests to a Cox regression model derived from stepwise variable selection.","Longitudinal data from factorial experiments frequently arise in various fields of study, ranging from medicine and biology to public policy and sociology. In most practical situations, the distribution of observed data is unknown and there may exist a number of atypical measurements and outliers. Hence, use of parametric and semi-parametric procedures that impose restrictive distributional assumptions on observed longitudinal samples becomes questionable. This, in turn, has led to a substantial demand for statistical procedures that enable us to accurately and reliably analyze longitudinal measurements in factorial experiments with minimal conditions on available data, and robust nonparametric methodology offering such a possibility becomes of particular practical importance. In this article, we introduce a new R package nparLD which provides statisticians and researchers from other disciplines an easy and user-friendly access to the most up-to-date robust rank-based methods for the analysis of longitudinal data in factorial settings. We illustrate the implemented procedures by case studies from dentistry, biology, and medicine.","Clustering of variables is as a way to arrange variables into homogeneous clusters, i.e., groups of variables which are strongly related to each other and thus bring the same information. These approaches can then be useful for dimension reduction and variable selection. Several specific methods have been developed for the clustering of numerical variables. However concerning qualitative variables or mixtures of quantitative and qualitative variables, far fewer methods have been proposed. The R package ClustOfVar was specifically developed for this purpose. The homogeneity criterion of a cluster is defined as the sum of correlation ratios (for qualitative variables) and squared correlations (for quantitative variables) to a synthetic quantitative variable, summarizing ``as good as possible'' the variables in the cluster. This synthetic variable is the first principal component obtained with the PCAMIX method. Two clustering algorithms are proposed to optimize the homogeneity criterion: iterative relocation algorithm and ascendant hierarchical clustering. We also propose a bootstrap approach in order to determine suitable numbers of clusters. We illustrate the methodologies and the associated package on small datasets.","We present an R package, msSurv, to calculate the marginal (that is, not conditional on any covariates) state occupation probabilities, the state entry and exit time distributions, and the marginal integrated transition hazard for a general, possibly non-Markov, multistate system under left-truncation and right censoring. For a Markov model, msSurv also calculates and returns the transition probability matrix between any two states. Dependent censoring is handled via modeling the censoring hazard through observable covariates. Pointwise confidence intervals for the above mentioned quantities are obtained and returned for independent censoring from closed-form variance estimators and for dependent censoring using the bootstrap.","Emerging technologies in the experimental sciences have opened the way for large-scale experiments. Such experiments generate ever growing amounts of data from which researchers need to extract relevant pieces for subsequent analysis. R offers a great environment for statistical analysis. However, due to the diversity of possible data sources and formats, data preprocessing and import can be time consuming especially with data that require user interaction such as editing, filtering or formatting. Writing a code for these tasks can be time-consuming, error prone and rather complex. We present speedR, an R-package for interactive data import, filtering and code generation in order to address these needs. Using speedR, researchers can import new data, make basic corrections, examine current R session objects, open them in the speedR environment for filtering (subsetting), put the filtered data back into R, and even create new R functions with applied import and filtering constraints to speed up their productivity.","This paper is devoted to the R package fda.usc which includes some utilities for functional data analysis. This package carries out exploratory and descriptive analysis of functional data analyzing its most important features such as depth measurements or functional outliers detection, among others. The R package fda.usc also includes functions to compute functional regression models, with a scalar response and a functional explanatory data via non-parametric functional regression, basis representation or functional principal components analysis. There are natural extensions such as functional linear models and semi-functional partial linear models, which allow non-functional covariates and factors and make predictions. The functions of this package complement and incorporate the two main references of functional data analysis: The R package fda and the functions implemented by Ferraty and Vieu (2006).","R has gained explicit text mining support with the tm package enabling statisticians to answer many interesting research questions via statistical analysis or modeling of (text) corpora. However, we typically face two challenges when analyzing large corpora: (1) the amount of data to be processed in a single machine is usually limited by the available main memory (i.e., RAM), and (2) the more data to be analyzed the higher the need for efficient procedures for calculating valuable results. Fortunately, adequate programming models like MapReduce facilitate parallelization of text mining tasks and allow for processing data sets beyond what would fit into memory by using a distributed file system possibly spanning over several machines, e.g., in a cluster of workstations. In this paper we present a plug-in package to tm called tm.plugin.dc implementing a distributed corpus class which can take advantage of the Hadoop MapReduce library for large scale text mining tasks. We show on the basis of an application in culturomics that we can efficiently handle data sets of significant size.","This document describes classes and methods designed to deal with different types of spatio-temporal data in R implemented in the R package spacetime, and provides examples for analyzing them. It builds upon the classes and methods for spatial data from package sp, and for time series data from package xts. The goal is to cover a number of useful representations for spatio-temporal sensor data, and results from predicting (spatial and/or temporal interpolation or smoothing), aggregating, or subsetting them, and to represent trajectories. The goals of this paper is to explore how spatio-temporal data can be sensibly represented in classes, and to find out which analysis and visualisation methods are useful and feasible. We discuss the time series convention of representing time intervals by their starting time only. This document is the main reference for the R package spacetime, and is available (in updated form) as a vignette in this package.","Data frames are integral to R. They provide a standard format for passing data to model-fitting and plotting functions, and this standard makes it easier for experienced users to learn new functions that accept data as a single data frame. Still, many data sets do not easily fit into a single data frame; data sets in ecology with a so-called fourth- corner problem provide important examples. Manipulating such inherently multiple-table data using several data frames can result in long and difficult-to-read workflows. We introduce the R multitable package to provide new data storage objects called data.list objects, which extend the data.frame concept to explicitly multiple-table settings. Like data frames, data lists are lists of variables stored as vectors; what is new is that these vectors have dimension attributes that make accessing and manipulating them easier. As data.list objects can be coerced to data.frame objects, they can be used with all R functions that accept an object that is coercible to a data.frame.","Sightability models are binary logistic-regression models used to estimate and adjust for visibility bias in wildlife-population surveys (Steinhorst and Samuel 1989). Estimation proceeds in 2 stages: (1) Sightability trials are conducted with marked individuals, and logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of detection as a function of available covariates (e.g., visual obstruction, group size). (2) The fitted model is used to adjust counts (from future surveys) for animals that were not observed. A modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator is used to estimate abundance: counts of observed animal groups are divided by their inclusion probabilites (determined by plot-level sampling probabilities and the detection probabilities estimated from stage 1). We provide a brief historical account of the approach, clarifying and documenting suggested modifications to the variance estimators originally proposed by Steinhorst and Samuel (1989). We then introduce a new R package, SightabilityModel, for estimating abundance using this technique. Lastly, we illustrate the software with a series of examples using data collected from moose (Alces alces) in northeastern Minnesota and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in Washington State.","Frailty models are getting more and more popular to account for overdispersion and/or clustering in survival data. When the form of the baseline hazard is somehow known in advance, the parametric estimation approach can be used advantageously. Nonetheless, there is no unified widely available software that deals with the parametric frailty model. The new parfm package remedies that lack by providing a wide range of parametric frailty models in R. The gamma, inverse Gaussian, and positive stable frailty distributions can be specified, together with five different baseline hazards. Parameter estimation is done by maximising the marginal log-likelihood, with right-censored and possibly left-truncated data. In the multivariate setting, the inverse Gaussian may encounter numerical difficulties with a huge number of events in at least one cluster. The positive stable model shows analogous difficulties but an ad-hoc solution is implemented, whereas the gamma model is very resistant due to the simplicity of its Laplace transform.","The R package MixSim is a new tool that allows simulating mixtures of Gaussian distributions with different levels of overlap between mixture components. Pairwise overlap, defined as a sum of two misclassification probabilities, measures the degree of interaction between components and can be readily employed to control the clustering complexity of datasets simulated from mixtures. These datasets can then be used for systematic performance investigation of clustering and finite mixture modeling algorithms. Among other capabilities of MixSim, there are computing the exact overlap for Gaussian mixtures, simulating Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, simulating outliers and noise variables, calculating various measures of agreement between two partitionings, and constructing parallel distribution plots for the graphical display of finite mixture models. All features of the package are illustrated in great detail. The utility of the package is highlighted through a small comparison study of several popular clustering algorithms.","Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) is a general approach for constructing an efficient double-robust semi-parametric substitution estimator of a causal effect parameter or statistical association measure. tmle is a recently developed R package that implements TMLE of the effect of a binary treatment at a single point in time on an outcome of interest, controlling for user supplied covariates, including an additive treatment effect, relative risk, odds ratio, and the controlled direct effect of a binary treatment controlling for a binary intermediate variable on the pathway from treatment to the out- come. Estimation of the parameters of a marginal structural model is also available. The package allows outcome data with missingness, and experimental units that contribute repeated records of the point-treatment data structure, thereby allowing the analysis of longitudinal data structures. Relevant factors of the likelihood may be modeled or fit data-adaptively according to user specifications, or passed in from an external estimation procedure. Effect estimates, variances, p values, and 95% confidence intervals are provided by the software.","In research of medicines, the comparison of treatments, test articles, conditions, administrations, etc., is very common. Studies are completed, and the data are then most often analyzed with a default mixture of equal variance t tests, analysis of variance, and multiple comparison procedures. But even for an implicit, presumed one-factor linear model to compare groups, more often than not there is the added need to accommodate data which is better suited for expression of multiplicative effects, potential outliers, and limits of detection. Base R and contributed packages provide all the pieces to develop a comprehensive strategy to account for these needs. Such an approach includes exploration of the data, fitting models, formal analysis to gauge the magnitude of effects, and checking of assumptions. The cg package is developed with those goals in mind, using a flow of wrapper functions to guide the full analysis and interpretation of the data. Examples from our non-clinical world of research will be used to illustrate the package and strategy.","Exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) represent a powerful and flexible class of models for the statistical analysis of networks. statnet is a suite of software packages that implement these models. This paper details how the capabilities for ERGM modeling can be expanded and customized by programming additional network statistics that may be included in ERGMs. We describe a template R package called ergm.userterms that can be modified for this purpose. It is designed to make this process as straightforward as possible. We also explain some of the internal workings of statnet that will help users develop their own network analysis capabilities.","Flexible multivariate distributions are needed in many areas. The popular multivariate Gaussian distribution is however very restrictive and cannot account for features like asymmetry and heavy tails. Therefore dependence modeling using copulas is nowadays very common to account for such patterns. The use of copulas is however challenging in higher dimensions, where standard multivariate copulas suffer from rather inflexible structures. Vine copulas overcome such limitations and are able to model complex dependency patterns by benefiting from the rich variety of bivariate copulas as building blocks. This article presents the R package CDVine which provides functions and tools for statistical inference of canonical vine (C-vine) and D-vine copulas. It contains tools for bivariate exploratory data analysis and for bivariate copula selection as well as for selection of pair-copula families in a vine. Models can be estimated either sequentially or by joint maximum likelihood estimation. Sampling algorithms and graphical methods are also included.","This paper introduces an R package for spatial and spatio-temporal prediction and forecasting for log-Gaussian Cox processes. The main computational tool for these models is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the new package, lgcp, therefore also provides an extensible suite of functions for implementing MCMC algorithms for processes of this type. The modeling framework and details of inferential procedures are first presented before a tour of lgcp functionality is given via a walk-through data-analysis. Topics covered include reading in and converting data, estimation of the key components and parameters of the model, specifying output and simulation quantities, computation of Monte Carlo expectations, post-processing and simulation of data sets.","Identifying the language used will typically be the first step in most natural language processing tasks. Among the wide variety of language identification methods discussed in the literature, the ones employing the Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) approach to text categorization based on character n-gram frequencies have been particularly successful. This paper presents the R extension package textcat for n-gram based text categorization which implements both the Cavnar and Trenkle approach as well as a reduced n-gram approach designed to remove redundancies of the original approach. A multi-lingual corpus obtained from the Wikipedia pages available on a selection of topics is used to illustrate the functionality of the package and the performance of the provided language identification methods.","Cloud computing is a relatively new technology that facilitates collaborative creation and modification of documents over the internet in real time. Here we provide an introductory assessment of the available statistical functions in three leading cloud spreadsheets namely Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel Web App, and Zoho Sheet. Our results show that the developers of cloud-based spreadsheets are not performing basic quality control, resulting in statistical computations that are misleading and erroneous. Moreover, the developers do not provide sufficient information regarding the software and the hardware, which can change at any time without notice. Indeed, rerunning the tests after several months we obtained different and sometimes worsened results.","Moult is the process by which birds replace their feathers. It is a costly process in terms of energy and reduced flight ability but necessary for the maintenance of the plumage and its functions. Because birds generally avoid to moult while engaged with other energy demanding activities such as breeding and migration, the analysis of moult data gives insight into how birds fit this life stage into the annual cycle, on time constraints in the annual cycle, and on the effects of environmental variables on the timing of moult. The analysis of moult data requires non-standard statistical techniques. More than 20~years ago Underhill and Zucchini developed a likelihood approach for estimating duration, mean start date and variation in start date of a population of moulting birds. However, use of these models has been limited, mainly due to the lack of user-friendly software. The moult package for R implements the Underhill-Zucchini models, allowing the user to specify moult models in a regression type formula. In addition the functions allow the moult parameters (duration, and mean and variation in start date) to depend on explanatory variables. We here describe the package, give a brief summary of the theory and illustrate the models on two datasets included in the package.","The basic purpose of the economic design of the control charts is to find the optimum control charts parameters to minimize the process cost. In this paper, an R package, edcc (economic design of control charts), which provides a numerical method to find the optimum chart parameters is presented using the unified approach of the economic design. Also, some examples are given to illustrate how to use this package. The types of the control chart available in the edcc package are X?, CUSUM (cumulative sum), and EWMA (exponentially-weighted moving average) control charts.","We propose an algorithm for evaluation of the cumulative bivariate normal distribution, building upon Marsaglia's ideas for evaluation of the cumulative univariate normal distribution. The algorithm delivers competitive performance and can easily be extended to arbitrary precision.","We illustrate how to fit multilevel models in the MLwiN package seamlessly from within Stata using the Stata program runmlwin. We argue that using MLwiN and Stata in combination allows researchers to capitalize on the best features of both packages. We provide examples of how to use runmlwin to fit continuous, binary, ordinal, nominal and mixed response multilevel models by both maximum likelihood and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation.","MIXREGLS is a program which provides estimates for a mixed-effects location scale model assuming a (conditionally) normally-distributed dependent variable. This model can be used for analysis of data in which subjects may be measured at many observations and interest is in modeling the mean and variance structure. In terms of the variance structure, covariates can by specified to have effects on both the between-subject and within-subject variances. Another use is for clustered data in which subjects are nested within clusters (e.g. clinics, hospitals, schools, etc.) and interest is in modeling the between-cluster and within-cluster variances in terms of covariates. MIXREGLS was written in Fortran and uses maximum likelihood estimation, utilizing both the EM algorithm and a Newton-Raphson solution. Estimation of the random effects is accomplished using empirical Bayes methods. Examples illustrating stand-alone usage and features of MIXREGLS are provided, as well as use via the SAS and R software packages.","Animated graphs that demonstrate statistical ideas and methods can both attract interest and assist understanding. In this paper we first discuss how animations can be related to some statistical topics such as iterative algorithms, random simulations, (re)sampling methods and dynamic trends, then we describe the approaches that may be used to create animations, and give an overview to the R package animation, including its design, usage and the statistical topics in the package. With the animation package, we can export the animations produced by R into a variety of formats, such as a web page, a GIF animation, a Flash movie, a PDF document, or an MP4/AVI video, so that users can publish the animations fairly easily. The design of this package is flexible enough to be readily incorporated into web applications, e.g., we can generate animations online with Rweb, which means we do not even need R to be installed locally to create animations. We will show examples of the use of animations in teaching statistics and in the presentation of statistical reports using Sweave or knitr. In fact, this paper itself was written with the knitr and animation package, and the animations are embedded in the PDF document, so that readers can watch the animations in real time when they read the paper (the Adobe Reader is required).\n\t\nAnimations can add insight and interest to traditional static approaches to teaching statistics and reporting, making statistics a more interesting and appealing subject.","stpp is an R package for analyzing, simulating and displaying space-time point patterns. It covers many of the models encountered in applications of point process methods to the study of spatio-temporal phenomena. The package also includes estimators of the space-time inhomogeneous K-function and pair correlation function. stpp is the first dedicated unified computational environment in the area of spatio-temporal point processes. In this paper we describe space-time point processes and introduce the package stpp to new users.","We present the FRB package for R, which implements the fast and robust bootstrap. This method constitutes an alternative to ordinary bootstrap or asymptotic inference procedures when using robust estimators such as S-, MM- or GS-estimators. The package considers three multivariate settings: principal components analysis, Hotelling tests and multivariate regression. It provides both the robust point estimates and uncertainty measures based on the fast and robust bootstrap. In this paper we give some background on the method, discuss the implementation and provide various examples.","Genetic algorithms (GAs) are stochastic search algorithms inspired by the basic principles of biological evolution and natural selection. GAs simulate the evolution of living organisms, where the fittest individuals dominate over the weaker ones, by mimicking the biological mechanisms of evolution, such as selection, crossover and mutation. GAs have been successfully applied to solve optimization problems, both for continuous (whether differentiable or not) and discrete functions.\n\nThis paper describes the R package GA, a collection of general purpose functions that provide a flexible set of tools for applying a wide range of genetic algorithm methods. Several examples are discussed, ranging from mathematical functions in one and two dimensions known to be hard to optimize with standard derivative-based methods, to some selected statistical problems which require the optimization of user defined objective functions. (This paper contains animations that can be viewed using the Adobe Acrobat PDF viewer.)","We describe an R package cts for fitting a modified form of continuous time autoregressive model, which can be particularly useful with unequally sampled time series. The estimation is based on the application of the Kalman filter. The paper provides the methods and algorithms implemented in the package, including parameter estimation, spectral analysis, forecasting, model checking and Kalman smoothing. The package contains R functions which interface underlying Fortran routines. The package is applied to geophysical and medical data for illustration.","Network analysis is one of the most widely used techniques in many areas of modern science. Most existing tools for that purpose are limited to drawing networks and computing their basic general characteristics. The user is not able to interactively and graphically manipulate the networks, select and explore subgraphs using other statistical and data mining techniques, add and plot various other data within the graph, and so on. In this paper we present a tool that addresses these challenges, an add-on for exploration of networks within the general component-based environment Orange.","The R package extracat provides two new graphical methods for displaying categorical data extending the concepts of multiple barcharts and parallel coordinates plots. The first method called rmb plot uses a crossover of mosaicplots and multiple barcharts to display the frequencies of a data table split up into conditional relative frequencies of one target variable and the absolute frequencies of the corresponding combinations of the remaining explanatory variables. It provides a well-structured representation of the data which is easy to interpret and allows precise comparisons. The graphic can additionally be used as a generalization of spineplots or with barcharts for the conditional relative frequencies. Several options, including ceiling censored zooming, residual shadings and a choice of color palettes, are provided. An interactive version based on the R package iWidgets is also presented. The second graphic cpcp uses the interactive parallel coordinates plots in the iplots package to visualize categorical data. Sequences of points are used to represent each of the variable categories, while ordering algorithms are applied to represent a hierarchical structure in the data and keep the arrangement clear. This interactive graphic is well-suited for exploratory analysis and allows a visual interpretation even for a higher number of variables and a mixture of categorical and numeric scales.","The profdpm package facilitates inference at the posterior mode for a class of product partition models. Dirichlet process mixtures are currently the only available class members. Several methods are implemented to search for the maximum posterior estimate of the data partition. This article discusses the relevant theory, the R and underlying C implementation, and examples of high level functionality.","The fastcluster package is a C++ library for hierarchical, agglomerative clustering. It provides a fast implementation of the most efficient, current algorithms when the input is a dissimilarity index. Moreover, it features memory-saving routines for hierarchical clustering of vector data. It improves both asymptotic time complexity (in most cases) and practical performance (in all cases) compared to the existing implementations in standard software: several R packages, MATLAB, Mathematica, Python with SciPy.","Orthogonal fractional factorial designs (OFFDs) are frequently used in many fields of application, including medicine, engineering and agriculture. In this paper we present a software tool for the generation of minimum size OFFDs. The software, that has been implemented in SAS/IML, puts neither a restriction on the number of levels of each factor nor on the orthogonality constraints. The algorithm is based on the joint use of polynomial counting function and complex coding of levels and follows the approach presented in Fontana (2013).","The solution of a (stochastic) differential equation can be locally approximated by a (stochastic) expansion. If the vector field of the differential equation is a polynomial, the corresponding expansion is a linear combination of iterated integrals of the drivers and can be calculated using Picard Iterations. However, such expansions grow exponentially fast in their number of terms, due to their specific algebra, rendering their practical use limited.\n\nWe present a Mathematica procedure that addresses this issue by reparametrizing the polynomials and distributing the load in as small as possible parts that can be processed and manipulated independently, thus alleviating large memory requirements and being perfectly suited for parallelized computation. We also present an iterative implementation of the shuffle product (as opposed to a recursive one, more usually implemented) as well as a fast way for calculating the expectation of iterated Stratonovich integrals for Brownian motion.","In this paper we present the Stata package stgenreg for the parametric analysis of survival data. Any user-defined hazard function can be specified, with the model estimated using maximum likelihood utilising numerical quadrature. Models that can be fitted range from the Weibull proportional hazards model to the generalized gamma model, mixture models, cure rate models, accelerated failure time models and relative survival models. We illustrate the features of stgenreg through application to a cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer with outcome all-cause death.","Boosting and bagging are two widely used ensemble methods for classification. Their common goal is to improve the accuracy of a classifier combining single classifiers which are slightly better than random guessing. Among the family of boosting algorithms, AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) is the best known, although it is suitable only for dichotomous tasks. AdaBoost.M1 and SAMME (stagewise additive modeling using a multi-class exponential loss function) are two easy and natural extensions to the general case of two or more classes. In this paper, the adabag R package is introduced. This version implements AdaBoost.M1, SAMME and bagging algorithms with classification trees as base classifiers. Once the ensembles have been trained, they can be used to predict the class of new samples. The accuracy of these classifiers can be estimated in a separated data set or through cross validation. Moreover, the evolution of the error as the ensemble grows can be analysed and the ensemble can be pruned. In addition, the margin in the class prediction and the probability of each class for the observations can be calculated. Finally, several classic examples in classification literature are shown to illustrate the use of this package.","This article presents inlinedocs, an R package for generating documentation from comments. The concept of structured, interwoven code and documentation has existed for many years, but existing systems that implement this for the R programming language do not tightly integrate with R code, leading to several drawbacks. This article attempts to address these issues and presents 2 contributions for documentation generation for the R community. First, we propose a new syntax for inline documentation of R code within comments adjacent to the relevant code, which allows for highly readable and maintainable code and documentation. Second, we propose an extensible system for parsing these comments, which allows the syntax to be easily augmented.","The Stata  package ebalance  implements entropy balancing, a multivariate reweighting method described in Hainmueller  (2012 ) that allows users to reweight a dataset such that the covariate distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create balanced samples in observational studies with a binary treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known characteristics from a target population.","A joint optimization plot, shortly JOP, graphically displays the result of a loss function based robust parameter design for multiple responses. Different importance of reaching a target value can be assigned to the individual responses by weights. The JOP method simultaneously runs through a whole range of possible weights. For each weight matrix a parameter setting is derived which minimizes the estimated expected loss. The joint optimization plot displays these settings together with corresponding expected values and standard deviations of the response variable. The R package JOP provides all tools necessary to apply the JOP approach to a given data set. It also returns parameter settings for a desirable compromise of achieved expected responses chosen from the plot.","GLIMMPSE is a free, web-based software tool that calculates power and sample size for the general linear multivariate model with Gaussian errors (http://glimmpse.SampleSizeShop.org/). GLIMMPSE provides a user-friendly interface for the computation of power and sample size. We consider models with fixed predictors, and models with fixed predictors and a single Gaussian covariate. Validation experiments demonstrate that GLIMMPSE matches the accuracy of previously published results, and performs well against simulations. We provide several online tutorials based on research in head and neck cancer. The tutorials demonstrate the use of GLIMMPSE to calculate power and sample size.","The survPresmooth package for R implements nonparametric presmoothed estimators of the main functions studied in survival analysis (survival, density, hazard and cumulative hazard functions). Presmoothed versions of the classical nonparametric estimators have been shown to increase efficiency if the presmoothing bandwidth is suitably chosen. The survPresmooth package provides plug-in and bootstrap bandwidth selectors, also allowing the possibility of using fixed bandwidths.","We present the R package mixsmsn, which implements routines for maximum likeli- hood estimation (via an expectation maximization EM-type algorithm) in finite mixture models with components belonging to the class of scale mixtures of the skew-normal distribution, which we call the FMSMSN models. Both univariate and multivariate re- sponses are considered. It is possible to fix the number of components of the mixture to be fitted, but there exists an option that transfers this responsibility to an automated procedure, through the analysis of several models choice criteria. Plotting routines to generate histograms, plug-in densities and contour plots using the fitted models output are also available. The precision of the EM estimates can be evaluated through their esti- mated standard deviations, which can be obtained by the provision of an approximation of the associated information matrix for each particular model in the FMSMSN family. A function to generate artificial samples from several elements of the family is also supplied. Finally, two real data sets are analyzed in order to show the usefulness of the package.","This paper presents the R  package bcrm  for conducting and assessing Bayesian continual reassessment method (CRM) designs in Phase I dose-escalation trials. CRM designsare a class of adaptive design that select the dose to be given to the next recruited patient based on accumulating toxicity data from patients already recruited into the trial, often using Bayesian methodology. Despite the original CRM design being proposed in 1990, the methodology is still not widely implemented within oncology Phase I trials. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate, through example of the bcrm  package, how a variety of possible designs can be easily implemented within the R  statistical software, and how properties of the designs can be communicated to trial investigators using simple textual and graphical output obtained from the package. This in turn should facilitate an iterative process to allow a design to be chosen that is suitable to the needs of the investigator. Our bcrm  package is the first to offer a large comprehensive choice of CRM designs, priors and escalation procedures, which can be easily compared and contrasted within the package through the assessment of operating characteristics.","A common strategy for the analysis of object-attribute associations is to derive a low- dimensional spatial representation of objects and attributes which involves a compensatory model (e.g., principal components analysis) to explain the strength of object-attribute associations. As an alternative, probabilistic latent feature models assume that objects and attributes can be represented as a set of binary latent features and that the strength of object-attribute associations can be explained as a non-compensatory (e.g., disjunctive or conjunctive) mapping of latent features. In this paper, we describe the R package plfm which comprises functions for conducting both classical and Bayesian probabilistic latent feature analysis with disjunctive or a conjunctive mapping rules. Print and summary functions are included to summarize results on parameter estimation, model selection and the goodness of fit of the models. As an example the functions of plfm are used to analyze product-attribute data on the perception of car models, and situation-behavior associations on the situational determinants of anger-related behavior.","Units sampled from finite populations typically come with different inclusion proba- bilities. Together with additional preprocessing steps of the raw data, this yields unequal sampling weights of the observations. Whenever indicators are estimated from such com- plex samples, the corresponding sampling weights have to be taken into account. In addition, many indicators suffer from a strong influence of outliers, which are a common problem in real-world data. The R package laeken is an object-oriented toolkit for the estimation of indicators from complex survey samples via standard or robust methods. In particular the most widely used social exclusion and poverty indicators are imple- mented in the package. A general calibrated bootstrap method to estimate the variance of indicators for common survey designs is included as well. Furthermore, the package contains synthetically generated close-to-reality data for the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and the Structure of Earnings Survey, which are used in the code examples throughout the paper. Even though the paper is focused on showing the functionality of package laeken, it also provides a brief mathematical description of the implemented indicator methodology.","This article describes the R package costat. This package enables a user to (i) perform a test for time series stationarity; (ii) compute and plot time-localized autocovariances, and (iii) to determine and explore any costationary relationship between two locally stationary time series. Two locally stationary time series are said to be costationary if there exists two time-varying combination functions such that the linear combination of the two series with the functions produces another time series which is stationary. Costationarity existing between two time series indicates a relationship between the series that might be usefully exploited in a number of ways. Sometimes the relationship itself is of interest, sometimes the derived stationary series is of interest and useful as a substitute for either of the original stationary series in some applications.","We present a new MATLAB toolbox under Windows and Linux for nonparametric regression estimation based on the statistical library for least squares support vector machines (StatLSSVM). The StatLSSVM toolbox is written so that only a few lines of code are necessary in order to perform standard nonparametric regression, regression with correlated errors and robust regression. In addition, construction of additive models and pointwise or uniform confidence intervals are also supported. A number of tuning criteria such as classical cross-validation, robust cross-validation and cross-validation for correlated errors are available. Also, minimization of the previous criteria is available without any user interaction.","Developing efficient gamma variate generators is important for Monte Carlo methods. With a brief review of existing methods for generating gamma random numbers, this article proposes two simple gamma variate generators that are obtained from the ratio- of-uniforms method and based on two logarithmic transformations of the gamma random variable. One transformation allows for the generators to work for all shape parameter values. The other is introduced to have improved efficiency for shape parameters smaller than or equal to one.","In medical and epidemiological studies, the odds ratio is a commonly applied measure to approximate the relative risk or risk ratio in cohort studies. It is well known tha such an approximation is poor and can generate misleading conclusions, if the incidence rate of a study outcome is not rare. However, there are times when the incidence rate is not directly available in the published work. Motivated by real applications, this paper presents methods to convert the odds ratio to the relative risk when published data offers limited information. Specifically, the proposed new methods can convert the odds ratio to the relative risk, if an odds ratio and/or a confidence interval as well as the sample sizes for the treatment and control group are available. In addition, the developed methods can be utilized to approximate the relative risk based on the adjusted odds ratio from logistic regression or other multiple regression models. In this regard, this paper extends a popular method by Zhang and Yu (1998) for converting odds ratios to risk ratios. The objective is novelly mapped into a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, which is solved with both a grid search and a nonlinear optimization algorithm. The methods are implemented in R package orsk which contains R functions and a Fortran subroutine for efficiency. The proposed methods and software are illustrated with real data applications.","In standardized testing it is important to equate tests in order to ensure that the test takers, regardless of the test version given, obtain a fair test. Recently, the kernel method of test equating, which is a conjoint framework of test equating, has gained popularity. The kernel method of test equating includes five steps: (1) pre-smoothing, (2) estimation of the score probabilities, (3) continuization, (4) equating, and (5) computing the standard error of equating and the standard error of equating difference. Here, an implementation has been made for six different equating designs: equivalent groups, single group, counter balanced, non-equivalent groups with anchor test using either chain equating or post- stratification equating, and non-equivalent groups using covariates. An R package for the kernel method of test equating called kequate is presented. Included in the package are also diagnostic tools aiding in the search for a proper log-linear model in the pre-smoothing step for use in conjunction with the R function glm.","The increasing availability of cloud computing and scientific super computers brings great potential for making R accessible through public or shared resources. This allows us to efficiently run code requiring lots of cycles and memory, or embed R functionality into, e.g., systems and web services. However some important security concerns need to be addressed before this can be put in production. The prime use case in the design of R has always been a single statistician running R on the local machine through the interactive console. Therefore the execution environment of R is entirely unrestricted, which could result in malicious behavior or excessive use of hardware resources in a shared environment. Properly securing an R process turns out to be a complex problem. We describe various approaches and illustrate potential issues using some of our personal experiences in hosting public web services. Finally we introduce the RAppArmor package: a Linux based reference implementation for dynamic sandboxing in R on the level of the operating system.","The high-dimensionality typically associated with discretized approximations to Gaussian random fields is a considerable hinderance to computationally efficient methods for their simulation. Many direct approaches require spectral decompositions of the associated covariance matrix and so are unable to complete the solving process in a timely fashion, if at all. However under certain conditions, we may construct block-circulant versions of the covariance matrix at hand thereby allowing access to fast-Fourier methods to perform the required operations with impressive speed. We demonstrate how circulant embedding and subsequent simulation can be performed directly in the R language. The approach is currently implemented in C for the R package RandomFields, and used in the recently released package lgcp. Motivated by applications dealing with spatial point processes we restrict attention to stationary Gaussian fields on R2, where sparsity of the covariance matrix cannot necessarily be assumed.","It is possible to model life contingency insurances with the lifecontingencies R package, which is capable of performing financial and actuarial mathematics calculations. Its functions permit one to determine both the expected value and the stochastic distribution of insured benefits. Therefore, life insurance coverage can be priced and portfolios risk-based capital requirements can be assessed. This paper briefly summarizes the theory regarding life contingencies that is based on financial mathematics and demographic con- cepts. Then, with the aid of applied examples, it shows how the lifecontingencies package can be a useful tool for executing routine, deterministic, or stochastic calculations for life-contingencies actuarial mathematics.","We describe a simple way to construct new statistical models for spatial point pattern data. Taking two or more existing models (finite Gibbs spatial point processes) we multiply the probability densities together and renormalise to obtain a new probability density. We call the resulting model a hybrid. We discuss stochastic properties of hybrids, their statistical implications, statistical inference, computational strategies and software implementation in the R package spatstat. Hybrids are particularly useful for constructing models which exhibit interaction at different spatial scales. The methods are demonstrated on a real data set on human social interaction. Software and data are provided.","This paper describes an algorithm for fitting finite mixtures of unrestricted Multivariate Skew t (FM-uMST) distributions. The package EMMIXuskew implements a closed-form expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters for the (unrestricted) FM-MST model in R. EMMIXuskew also supports visualization of fitted contours in two and three dimensions, and random sample generation from a specified FM-uMST distribution.\nFinite mixtures of skew t distributions have proven to be useful in modelling heterogeneous data with asymmetric and heavy tail behaviour, for example, datasets from flow cytometry. In recent years, various versions of mixtures with multivariate skew t (MST) distributions have been proposed. However, these models adopted some restricted characterizations of the component MST distributions so that the E-step of the EM algorithm can be evaluated in closed form. This paper focuses on mixtures with unrestricted MST components, and describes an iterative algorithm for the computation of the ML estimates of its model parameters. Its implementation in R is presented with the package EMMIXuskew.\nThe usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in three applications to real datasets. The first example illustrates the use of the main function fmmst in the package by fitting a MST distribution to a bivariate unimodal flow cytometric sample. The second example fits a mixture of MST distributions to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) data, and demonstrates that EMMIXuskew can provide better clustering results than mixtures with restricted MST components. In the third example, EMMIXuskew is applied to classify cells in a trivariate flow cytometric dataset. Comparisons with some other available methods suggest that EMMIXuskew achieves a lower misclassification rate with respect to the labels given by benchmark gating analysis.","Conditional autoregressive models are commonly used to represent spatial autocorrelation in data relating to a set of non-overlapping areal units, which arise in a wide variety of applications including agriculture, education, epidemiology and image analysis. Such models are typically specified in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, with inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The most widely used software to fit such models is WinBUGS or OpenBUGS, but in this paper we introduce the R package CARBayes. The main advantage of CARBayes compared with the BUGS software is its ease of use, because: (1) the spatial adjacency information is easy to specify as a binary neighbourhood matrix; and (2) given the neighbourhood matrix the models can be implemented by a single function call in R. This paper outlines the general class of Bayesian hierarchical models that can be implemented in the CARBayes software, describes their implementation via MCMC simulation techniques, and illustrates their use with two worked examples in the fields of house price analysis and disease mapping.","This paper presents two complementary statistical computing frameworks that address challenges in parallel processing and the analysis of massive data. First, the foreach package allows users of the R programming environment to define parallel loops that may be run sequentially on a single machine, in parallel on a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) machine, or in cluster environments without platform-specific code. Second, the bigmemory package implements memory- and file-mapped data structures that provide (a) access to arbitrarily large data while retaining a look and feel that is familiar to R users and (b) data structures that are shared across processor cores in order to support efficient parallel computing techniques. Although these packages may be used independently, this paper shows how they can be used in combination to address challenges that have effectively been beyond the reach of researchers who lack specialized software development skills or expensive hardware.","This article describes the R package FrF2 for design and analysis of experiments with 2-level factors. The package offers both regular and non-regular fractional factorial 2-level designs, in the regular case with blocking and split plot facilities and algorithms for ensuring estimability of certain two-factor interactions. Furthermore, simple analysis facilities are on offer, first and foremost plotting functions for half normal plots, main effects and interaction plots, and cube plots. Package FrF2 receives infrastructure support from package DoE.base and heavily builds on a subgraph isomorphism algorithm from package igraph for one of its estimability algorithms.","This paper describes the STARS ArcGIS geoprocessing toolset, which is used to calcu- late the spatial information needed to fit spatial statistical models to stream network data using the SSN package. The STARS toolset is designed for use with a landscape network (LSN), which is a topological data model produced by the FLoWS ArcGIS geoprocessing toolset. An overview of the FLoWS LSN structure and a few particularly useful tools is also provided so that users will have a clear understanding of the underlying data struc- ture that the STARS toolset depends on. This document may be used as an introduction to new users. The methods used to calculate the spatial information and format the final .ssn object are also explicitly described so that users may create their own .ssn object using other data models and software.","Over the last twenty years there have been numerous developments in diagnostic pro- cedures for hierarchical linear models; however, these procedures are not widely imple- mented in statistical software packages, and those packages that do contain a complete framework for model assessment are not open source. The lack of availability of diagnostic procedures for hierarchical linear models has limited their adoption in statistical practice. The R package HLMdiag provides diagnostic tools targeting all aspects and levels of continuous response hierarchical linear models with strictly nested dependence structures fit using the lmer() function in the lme4 package. In this paper we discuss the tools implemented in HLMdiag for both residual and influence analysis.","For functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, researchers can use multi-subject blocked designs to identify active brain regions for a certain stimulus type of interest. Before performing such an experiment, careful planning is necessary to obtain efficient stimulus effect estimators within the available financial resources. The optimal number of subjects and the optimal scanning time for a multi-subject blocked design with fixed experimental costs can be determined using optimal design methods. In this paper, the user-friendly computer program POBE 1.2 (program for optimal design of blocked experiments, version 1.2) is presented. POBE provides a graphical user interface for fMRI researchers to easily and efficiently design their experiments. The computer program POBE calculates the optimal number of subjects and the optimal scanning time for user specified experimental factors and model parameters so that the statistical efficiency is maximised for a given study budget. POBE can also be used to determine the minimum budget for a given power. Furthermore, a maximin design can be determined as efficient design for a possible range of values for the unknown model parameters. In this paper, the computer program is described and illustrated with typical experimental factors for a blocked fMRI experiment.","We introduce here Momocs, a package intended to ease and popularize modern morphometrics with R, and particularly outline analysis, which aims to extract quantitative variables from shapes. It mostly hinges on the functions published in the book entitled Modern Morphometrics Using R by Claude (2008). From outline extraction from raw data to multivariate analysis, Momocs provides an integrated and convenient toolkit to students and researchers who are, or may become, interested in describing the shape and its variation. The methods implemented so far in Momocs are introduced through a simplistic case study that aims to test if two sets of bottles have different shapes.","This paper introduces the R package lavaan.survey, a user-friendly interface to design-based complex survey analysis of structural equation models (SEMs). By leveraging existing code in the lavaan and survey packages, the lavaan.survey package allows for SEM analyses of stratified, clustered, and weighted data, as well as multiply imputed complex survey data. lavaan.survey provides several features such as SEMs with replicate weights, a variety of resampling techniques for complex samples, and finite population corrections, features that should prove useful for SEM practitioners faced with the common situation of a sample that is not iid.","Rating scales, such as Likert scales, are very common in marketing research, customer satisfaction studies, psychometrics, opinion surveys, population studies, and numerous other fields. We recommend diverging stacked bar charts as the primary graphical display technique for Likert and related scales. We also show other applications where diverging stacked bar charts are useful. Many examples of plots of Likert scales are given. We discuss the perceptual and programming issues in constructing these graphs. We present two implementations for diverging stacked bar charts. Most examples in this paper were drawn with the likert function included in the HH package in R. We also have a dashboard in Tableau.","PySSM is a Python package that has been developed for the analysis of time series using linear Gaussian state space models. PySSM is easy to use; models can be set up quickly and efficiently and a variety of different settings are available to the user. It also takes advantage of scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy and other high level features of the Python language. PySSM is also used as a platform for interfacing between optimized and parallelized Fortran routines. These Fortran routines heavily utilize basic linear algebra and linear algebra Package functions for maximum performance. PySSM contains classes for filtering, classical smoothing as well as simulation smoothing.","The R package ThreeWay is presented and its main features are illustrated. The aim of ThreeWay is to offer a suit of functions for handling three-way arrays. In particular, the most relevant available functions are T3 and CP, which implement, respectively, the Tucker3 and Candecomp/Parafac methods. They are the two most popular tools for summarizing three-way arrays in terms of components. After briefly recalling both techniques from a theoretical point of view, the functions T3 and CP are described by considering three real life examples.","We describe the R package multiPIM, including statistical background, functionality and user options. The package is for variable importance analysis, and is meant primarily for analyzing data from exploratory epidemiological studies, though it could certainly be applied in other areas as well. The approach taken to variable importance comes from the causal inference field, and is different from approaches taken in other R packages. By default, multiPIM uses a double robust targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) of a parameter akin to the attributable risk. Several regression methods/machine learning algorithms are available for estimating the nuisance parameters of the models, including super learner, a meta-learner which combines several different algorithms into one. We describe a simulation in which the double robust TMLE is compared to the graphical computation estimator. We also provide example analyses using two data sets which are included with the package.","Two-phase designs, in which for a large study a dichotomous outcome and partial or proxy information on risk factors is available, whereas precise or complete measurements on covariates have been obtained only in a stratified sub-sample, extend the standard case-control design and have been proven useful in practice. The application of two-phase designs, however, seems to be hampered by the lack of appropriate, easy-to-use software. This paper introduces sas-twophase-package, a collection of SAS-macros, to fulfill this task. sas-twophase-package implements weighted likelihood, pseudo likelihood and semi- parametric maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm and via profile likelihood in two-phase settings with dichotomous outcome and a given stratification.","In this paper we present PaCAL, a Python package for arithmetical computations on random variables. The package is capable of performing the four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as well as computing many standard functions of random variables. Summary statistics, random number generation, plots, and histograms of the resulting distributions can easily be obtained and distribution parameter fitting is also available. The operations are performed numerically and their results interpolated allowing for arbitrary arithmetic operations on random variables following practically any probability distribution encountered in practice. The package is easy to use, as operations on random variables are performed just as they are on standard Python variables. Independence of random variables is, by default, assumed on each step but some computations on dependent random variables are also possible. We demonstrate on several examples that the results are very accurate, often close to machine precision. Practical applications include statistics, physical measurements or estimation of error distributions in scientific computations.","The R package pdfCluster performs cluster analysis based on a nonparametric estimate of the density of the observed variables. Functions are provided to encompass the whole process of clustering, from kernel density estimation, to clustering itself and subsequent graphical diagnostics. After summarizing the main aspects of the methodology, we describe the features and the usage of the package, and finally illustrate its application with the aid of two data sets.","The R package compareGroups provides functions meant to facilitate the construction of bivariate tables (descriptives of several variables for comparison between groups) and generates reports in several formats (LATEX, HTML or plain text CSV). Moreover, bivariate tables can be viewed directly on the R console in a nice format. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented to build the bivariate tables more easily for those users who are not familiar with the R software. Some new functions and methods have been incorporated in the newest version of the compareGroups package (version 1.x) to deal with time-to-event variables, stratifying tables, merging several tables, and revising the statistical methods used. The GUI interface also has been improved, making it much easier and more intuitive to set the inputs for building the bivariate tables. The first version (version 0.x) and this version were presented at the 2010 useR! conference (Sanz, Subirana, and Vila 2010) and the 2011 useR! conference (Sanz, Subirana, and Vila 2011), respectively. Package compareGroups is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=compareGroups.","Inference in quantile analysis has received considerable attention in the recent years. Linear quantile mixed models (Geraci and Bottai 2014) represent a flexible statistical tool to analyze data from sampling designs such as multilevel, spatial, panel or longitudinal, which induce some form of clustering. In this paper, I will show how to estimate conditional quantile functions with random effects using the R package lqmm. Modeling, estimation and inference are discussed in detail using a real data example. A thorough description of the optimization algorithms is also provided.","Problems with truncated data occur in many areas, complicating estimation and inference. Regarding linear regression models, the ordinary least squares estimator is inconsistent and biased for these types of data and is therefore unsuitable for use. Alternative estimators, designed for the estimation of truncated regression models, have been developed. This paper presents the R package truncSP. The package contains functions for the estimation of semi-parametric truncated linear regression models using three different estimators: the symmetrically trimmed least squares, quadratic mode, and left truncated estimators, all of which have been shown to have good asymptotic and finite sample properties. The package also provides functions for the analysis of the estimated models. Data from the environmental sciences are used to illustrate the functions in the package.","The RNetLogo package delivers an interface to embed the agent-based modeling platform NetLogo into the R environment with headless (no graphical user interface) or interactive GUI mode. It provides functions to load models, execute commands, push values, and to get values from NetLogo reporters. Such a seamless integration of a widely used agent-based modeling platform with a well-known statistical computing and graphics environment opens up various possibilities. For example, it enables the modeler to design simulation experiments, store simulation results, and analyze simulation output in a more systematic way. It can therefore help close the gaps in agent-based modeling regarding standards of description and analysis. After a short overview of the agent-based modeling approach and the software used here, the paper delivers a step-by-step introduction to the usage of the RNetLogo package by examples.","One of the key challenges in changepoint analysis is the ability to detect multiple changes within a given time series or sequence. The changepoint package has been developed to provide users with a choice of multiple changepoint search methods to use in conjunction with a given changepoint method and in particular provides an implementation of the recently proposed PELT algorithm. This article describes the search methods which are implemented in the package as well as some of the available test statistics whilst highlighting their application with simulated and practical examples. Particular emphasis is placed on the PELT algorithm and how results differ from the binary segmentation approach.","This paper presents the R package HAC, which provides user friendly methods for dealing with hierarchical Archimedean copulae (HAC). Computationally efficient estimation procedures allow to recover the structure and the parameters of HAC from data. In addition, arbitrary HAC can be constructed to sample random vectors and to compute the values of the corresponding cumulative distribution plus density functions. Accurate graphics of the HAC structure can be produced by the plot method implemented for these objects.","Item response theory (IRT) models are a class of statistical models used to describe the response behaviors of individuals to a set of items having a certain number of options. They are adopted by researchers in social science, particularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data, in psychology, education, medicine, marketing and other fields where the aim is to measure latent constructs. Most IRT analyses use parametric models that rely on assumptions that often are not satisfied. In such cases, a nonparametric approach might be preferable; nevertheless, there are not many software implementations allowing to use that.\n\nTo address this gap, this paper presents the R  package KernSmoothIRT . It implements kernel smoothing for the estimation of option characteristic curves, and adds several plotting and analytical tools to evaluate the whole test/questionnaire, the items, and the subjects. In order to show the package's capabilities, two real datasets are used, one employing multiple-choice responses, and the other scaled responses.","The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the R  package conting  for the Bayesian analysis of complete and incomplete contingency tables using hierarchical log-linear models. This package allows a user to identify interactions between categorical factors (via complete contingency tables) and to estimate closed population sizes using capture-recapture studies (via incomplete contingency tables). The models are fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular, implementations of the Metropolis-Hastings and reversible jump algorithms appropriate for log-linear models are employed. The conting  package is demonstrated on four real examples.","Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) comprise a class of widely used statistical tools for data analysis with fixed and random effects when the response variable has a conditional distribution in the exponential family. GLMM analysis also has a close relationship with actuarial credibility theory. While readily available programs such as the GLIMMIX  procedure in SAS  and the lme4  package in R  are powerful tools for using this class of models, these progarms are not able to handle models with thousands of levels of fixed and random effects. By using sparse-matrix and other high performance techniques, procedures such as HPMIXED in SAS can easily fit models with thousands of factor levels, but only for normally distributed response variables. In this paper, we present the %HPGLIMMIX SAS macro that fits GLMMs with large number of sparsely populated design matrices using the doubly-iterative linearization (pseudo-likelihood) method, in which the sparse-matrix-based HPMIXED  is used for the inner iterations with the pseudo-variable constructed from the inverse-link function and the chosen model. Although the macro does not have the full functionality of the GLIMMIX  procedure, time and memory savings can be large with the new macro. In applications in which design matrices contain many zeros and there are hundreds or thousands of factor levels, models can be fitted without exhausting computer memory, and 90% or better reduction in running time can be observed. Examples with a Poisson, binomial, and gamma conditional distribution are presented to demonstrate the usage and efficiency of this macro.","The use of copula-based models in EDAs (estimation of distribution algorithms) is currently an active area of research. In this context, the copulaedas  package for R provides a platform where EDAs based on copulas can be implemented and studied. The package offers complete implementations of various EDAs based on copulas and vines, a group of well-known optimization problems, and utility functions to study the performance of the algorithms. Newly developed EDAs can be easily integrated into the package by extending an S 4 class with generic functions for their main components. This paper presents copulaedas  by providing an overview of EDAs based on copulas, a description of the implementation of the package, and an illustration of its use through examples. The examples include running the EDAs defined in the package, implementing new algorithms, and performing an empirical study to compare the behavior of different algorithms on benchmark functions and a real-world problem.","Finite mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions allow to apply model-based clustering methods to data which is of standardized length, i.e., all data points lie on the unit sphere. The R package movMF contains functionality to draw samples from finite mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions and to fit these models using the expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation. Special features are the possibility to use sparse matrix representations for the input data, different variants of the expectation-maximization algorithm, different methods for determining the concentration parameters in the M-step and to impose constraints on the concentration parameters over the components. In this paper we describe the main fitting function of the package and illustrate its application. In addition we compare the clustering performance of finite mixtures of von Mises-Fisher distributions to spherical k-means. We also discuss the resolution of several numerical issues which occur for estimating the concentration parameters and for determining the normalizing constant of the von Mises-Fisher distribution.","Progress in molecular high-throughput techniques has led to the opportunity of a comprehensive monitoring of biomolecules in medical samples. In the era of personalized medicine, these data form the basis for the development of diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests for cancer. Because of the high number of features that are measured simultaneously in a relatively low number of samples, supervised learning approaches are sensitive to overfitting and performance overestimation. Bioinformatic methods were developed to cope with these problems including control of accuracy and precision. However, there is demand for easy-to-use software that integrates methods for classifier construction, performance assessment and development of diagnostic tests. To contribute to filling of this gap, we developed a comprehensive R package for the development and validation of diagnostic tests from high-dimensional molecular data. An important focus of the package is a careful validation of the classification results. To this end, we implemented an extended version of the multiple random validation protocol, a validation method that was introduced before. The package includes methods for continuous prediction scores. This is important in a clinical setting, because scores can be converted to probabilities and help to distinguish between clear-cut and borderline classification results. The functionality of the package is illustrated by the analysis of two cancer microarray data sets.","We present an R package for the simulation of simple and complex survival data. It covers different situations, including recurrent events and multiple events. The main simulation routine allows the user to introduce an arbitrary number of distributions, each corresponding to a new event or episode, with its parameters, choosing between the Weibull (and exponential as a particular case), log-logistic and log-normal distributions.","In this paper, we describe the R package mediation for conducting causal mediation analysis in applied empirical research. In many scientific disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal effects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally affects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is frequently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the standard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. We also implement a statistical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice. Finally, the package also offers a methodology for assessing causal mediation in the presence of treatment noncompliance, a common problem in randomized trials.","The R package phtt provides estimation procedures for panel data with large dimensions n, T, and general forms of unobservable heterogeneous effects. Particularly, the estimation procedures are those of Bai (2009) and Kneip, Sickles, and Song (2012), which complement one another very well: both models assume the unobservable heterogeneous effects to have a factor structure. Kneip et al. (2012) considers the case in which the time-varying common factors have relatively smooth patterns including strongly positively auto-correlated stationary as well as non-stationary factors, whereas the method of Bai (2009) focuses on stochastic bounded factors such as ARMA processes. Additionally, the phtt package provides a wide range of dimensionality criteria in order to estimate the number of the unobserved factors simultaneously with the remaining model parameters.","Equating is a family of statistical models and methods that are used to adjust scores on two or more versions of a test, so that the scores from different tests may be used interchangeably. In this paper we present the R package SNSequate which implements both standard and nonstandard statistical models and methods for test equating. The package construction was motivated by the need of having a modular, simple, yet comprehensive, and general software that carries out traditional and new equating methods. SNSequate currently implements the traditional mean, linear and equipercentile equating methods, as well as the mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara and Stocking-Lord item response theory linking methods. It also supports the newest methods such as local equating, kernel equating, and item response theory parameter linking methods based on asymmetric item characteristic functions. Practical examples are given to illustrate the capabilities of the software. A list of other programs for equating is presented, highlighting the main differences between them. Future directions for the package are also discussed.","dglars is a publicly available R package that implements the method proposed in Augugliaro, Mineo, and Wit (2013), developed to study the sparse structure of a generalized linear model. This method, called dgLARS, is based on a differential geometrical extension of the least angle regression method proposed in Efron, Hastie, Johnstone, and Tibshirani (2004). The core of the dglars package consists of two algorithms implemented in Fortran 90 to efficiently compute the solution curve: a predictor-corrector algorithm, proposed in Augugliaro et al. (2013), and a cyclic coordinate descent algorithm, proposed in Augugliaro, Mineo, and Wit (2012). The latter algorithm, as shown here, is significantly faster than the predictor-corrector algorithm. For comparison purposes, we have implemented both algorithms.","A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.","In this paper we show how complete hierarchical multinomial marginal (HMM) models for categorical variables can be defined, estimated and tested using the R package hmmm. Models involving equality and inequality constraints on marginal parameters are needed to define hypotheses of conditional independence, stochastic dominance or notions of positive dependence, or when the parameters are allowed to depend on covariates. The hmmm package also serves the need of estimating and testing HMM models under equality and inequality constraints on marginal interactions.","The R package structSSI provides an accessible implementation of two recently developed simultaneous and selective inference techniques: the group Benjamini-Hochberg and hierarchical false discovery rate procedures. Unlike many multiple testing schemes, these methods specifically incorporate existing information about the grouped or hierarchical dependence between hypotheses under consideration while controlling the false discovery rate. Doing so increases statistical power and interpretability. Furthermore, these procedures provide novel approaches to the central problem of encoding complex dependency between hypotheses.\nWe briefly describe the group Benjamini-Hochberg and hierarchical false discovery rate procedures and then illustrate them using two examples, one a measure of ecological microbial abundances and the other a global temperature time series. For both procedures, we detail the steps associated with the analysis of these particular data sets, including establishing the dependence structures, performing the test, and interpreting the results. These steps are encapsulated by R functions, and we explain their applicability to general data sets.","Numerical optimization is often an essential aspect of mathematical analysis in science, technology and other areas. The function optim() provides basic optimization capabilities and is among the most widely used functions in R . Additionally, there are various packages and functions for solving various types of optimization problem (the optimization task view on Comprehensive R  Archive Network provides a comprehensive list of available options for solving optimization problems in R). In this special volume, four papers are presented which discuss some of the areas in numerical optimization where significant developments have been made recently to enhance the capabilities in R . This introduction provides a brief overview of the volume.","R (R Core Team 2014) provides a powerful and flexible system for statistical computations. It has a default-install set of functionality that can be expanded by the use of several thousand add-in packages as well as user-written scripts. While  R is itself a programming language, it has proven relatively easy to incorporate programs in other languages, particularly  Fortran and  C. Success, however, can lead to its own costs:\n\nUsers face a confusion of choice when trying to select packages in approaching a problem.\nA need to maintain workable examples using early methods may mean some tools offered as a default may be dated.\nIn an open-source project like  R, how to decide what tools offer \"best practice\" choices, and how to implement such a policy, present a serious challenge.\n\nWe discuss these issues with reference to the tools in  R for nonlinear parameter estimation (NLPE) and optimization, though for the present article `optimization` will be limited to function minimization of essentially smooth functions with at most bounds constraints on the parameters. We will abbreviate this class of problems as NLPE. We believe that the concepts proposed are transferable to other classes of problems seen by R users.","Over the last two decades, it has been observed that using the gradient vector as a search direction in large-scale optimization may lead to efficient algorithms. The effectiveness relies on choosing the step lengths according to novel ideas that are related to the spectrum of the underlying local Hessian rather than related to the standard decrease in the objective function. A review of these so-called spectral projected gradient methods for convex constrained optimization is presented. To illustrate the performance of these low-cost schemes, an optimization problem on the set of positive definite matrices is described.","Trust region algorithms are nonlinear optimization tools that tend to be stable and reliable when the objective function is non-concave, ill-conditioned, or exhibits regions that are nearly flat. Additionally, most freely-available optimization routines do not exploit the sparsity of the Hessian when such sparsity exists, as in log posterior densities of Bayesian hierarchical models. The trustOptim package for the R programming language addresses both of these issues. It is intended to be robust, scalable and efficient for a large class of nonlinear optimization problems that are often encountered in statistics, such as finding posterior modes. The user must supply the objective function, gradient and Hessian. However, when used in conjunction with the sparseHessianFD package, the user does not need to supply the exact sparse Hessian, as long as the sparsity structure is known in advance. For models with a large number of parameters, but for which most of the cross-partial derivatives are zero (i.e., the Hessian is sparse), trustOptim offers dramatic performance improvements over existing options, in terms of computational time and memory footprint.","Convex optimization now plays an essential role in many facets of statistics. We briefly survey some recent developments and describe some implementations of these methods in R . Applications of linear and quadratic programming are introduced including quantile regression, the Huber M-estimator and various penalized regression methods. Applications to additively separable convex problems subject to linear equality and inequality constraints such as nonparametric density estimation and maximum likelihood estimation of general nonparametric mixture models are described, as are several cone programming problems. We focus throughout primarily on implementations in the R  environment that rely on solution methods linked to R, like MOSEK  by the package Rmosek. Code is provided in R  to illustrate several of these problems. Other applications are available in the R package REBayes, dealing with empirical Bayes estimation of nonparametric mixture models.","This article surveys currently available implementations in R for continuous global optimization problems. A new R package globalOptTests is presented that provides a set of standard test problems for continuous global optimization based on C  functions by Ali, Khompatraporn, and Zabinsky (2005). 48 of the objective functions contained in the package are used in empirical comparison of 18 R implementations in terms of the quality of the solutions found and speed.","Commonly used classification and regression tree methods like the CART algorithm are recursive partitioning methods that build the model in a forward stepwise search. Although this approach is known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to maximize homogeneity at the next step only. An alternative way to search over the parameter space of trees is to use global optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. This paper describes the evtree package, which implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning globally optimal classification and regression trees in R. Computationally intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while the partykit package is leveraged for representing the resulting trees in R, providing unified infrastructure for summaries, visualizations, and predictions. evtree is compared to the open-source CART implementation rpart, conditional inference trees (ctree), and the open-source C4.5 implementation J48. A benchmark study of predictive accuracy and complexity is carried out in which evtree achieved at least similar and most of the time better results compared to rpart, ctree, and J48. Furthermore, the usefulness of evtree in practice is illustrated in a textbook customer classification task.","In this paper we describe the main features of the Bergm package for the open-source R software which provides a comprehensive framework for Bayesian analysis of exponential random graph models: tools for parameter estimation, model selection and goodness-of- fit diagnostics. We illustrate the capabilities of this package describing the algorithms through a tutorial analysis of three network datasets.","In regression settings, a sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) method seeks the core information in a p-vector predictor that completely captures its relationship with a response. The reduced predictor may reside in a lower dimension d < p, improving ability to visualize data and predict future observations, and mitigating dimensionality issues when carrying out further analysis. We introduce ldr, a new R software package that implements three recently proposed likelihood-based methods for SDR: covariance reduction, likelihood acquired directions, and principal fitted components. All three methods reduce the dimensionality of the data by pro jection into lower dimensional subspaces. The package also implements a variable screening method built upon principal fitted components which makes use of flexible basis functions to capture the dependencies between the predictors and the response. Examples are given to demonstrate likelihood-based SDR analyses using ldr, including estimation of the dimension of reduction subspaces and selection of basis functions. The ldr package provides a framework that we hope to grow into a comprehensive library of likelihood-based SDR methodologies.","When designing a sampling survey, usually constraints are set on the desired precision levels regarding one or more target estimates (the Ys). If a sampling frame is available, containing auxiliary information related to each unit (the Xs), it is possible to adopt a stratified sample design. For any given stratification of the frame, in the multivariate case it is possible to solve the problem of the best allocation of units in strata, by minimizing a cost function sub ject to precision constraints (or, conversely, by maximizing the precision of the estimates under a given budget). The problem is to determine the best stratification in the frame, i.e., the one that ensures the overall minimal cost of the sample necessary to satisfy precision constraints. The Xs can be categorical or continuous; continuous ones can be transformed into categorical ones. The most detailed stratification is given by the Cartesian product of the Xs (the atomic strata). A way to determine the best stratification is to explore exhaustively the set of all possible partitions derivable by the set of atomic strata, evaluating each one by calculating the corresponding cost in terms of the sample required to satisfy precision constraints. This is unaffordable in practical situations, where the dimension of the space of the partitions can be very high. Another possible way is to explore the space of partitions with an algorithm that is particularly suitable in such situations: the genetic algorithm. The R package SamplingStrata, based on the use of a genetic algorithm, allows to determine the best stratification for a population frame, i.e., the one that ensures the minimum sample cost necessary to satisfy precision constraints, in a multivariate and multi-domain case.","The statistical analysis and modeling of natural images is an important branch of statistics with applications in image signaling, image compression, computer vision, and human perception. Because the space of all possible images is too large to be sampled exhaustively, natural image models must inevitably make assumptions in order to stay tractable. Subsequent model comparison can then filter out those models that best capture the statistical regularities in natural images. Proper model comparison, however, often requires that the models and the preprocessing of the data match down to the implementation details. Here we present the Natter, a statistical software toolbox for natural images models, that can provide such consistency. The Natter includes powerful but tractable baseline model as well as standardized data preprocessing steps. It has an extensive test suite to ensure correctness of its algorithms, it interfaces to the modular toolkit for data processing toolbox MDP, and provides simple ways to log the results of numerical experiments. Most importantly, its modular structure can be extended by new models with minimal coding effort, thereby providing a platform for the development and comparison of probabilistic models for natural image data.","Clustering is the partitioning of a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within a group are more similar to each others than objects in different groups. Most of the clustering algorithms depend on some assumptions in order to define the subgroups present in a data set. As a consequence, the resulting clustering scheme requires some sort of evaluation as regards its validity.\nThe evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems such as the quality of clusters, the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set and the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In the literature, a wide variety of indices have been proposed to find the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning of a data set during the clustering process. However, for most of indices proposed in the literature, programs are unavailable to test these indices and compare them.\nThe R package NbClust has been developed for that purpose. It provides 30 indices which determine the number of clusters in a data set and it offers also the best clustering scheme from different results to the user. In addition, it provides a function to perform k-means and hierarchical clustering with different distance measures and aggregation methods. Any combination of validation indices and clustering methods can be requested in a single function call. This enables the user to simultaneously evaluate several clustering schemes while varying the number of clusters, to help determining the most appropriate number of clusters for the data set of interest.","A web interface, named WebBUGS, is developed to conduct Bayesian analysis online over the Internet through OpenBUGS and R. WebBUGS can be used with the minimum requirement of a web browser both remotely and locally. WebBUGS has many collaborative features such as email notification and sharing. WebBUGS also eases the use of OpenBUGS by providing built-in model templates, data management module, and other useful modules. In this paper, the use of WebBUGS is illustrated and discussed.","Continuous diagnostic tests are often used for discriminating between healthy and diseased populations. For the clinical application of such tests, it is useful to select a cutpoint or discrimination value c that defines positive and negative test results. In general, individuals with a diagnostic test value of c or higher are classified as diseased. Several search strategies have been proposed for choosing optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests, depending on the underlying reason for this choice. This paper introduces an R package, known as OptimalCutpoints, for selecting optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests. It incorporates criteria that take the costs of the different diagnostic decisions into account, as well as the prevalence of the target disease and several methods based on measures of diagnostic test accuracy. Moreover, it enables optimal levels to be calculated according to levels of given (categorical) covariates. While the numerical output includes the optimal cutpoint values and associated accuracy measures with their confidence intervals, the graphical output includes the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and predictive ROC curves. An illustration of the use of OptimalCutpoints is provided, using a real biomedical dataset.","Nonparametric density and regression estimation methods for circular data are included in the R package NPCirc. Specifically, a circular kernel density estimation procedure is provided, jointly with different alternatives for choosing the smoothing parameter. In the regression setting, nonparametric estimation for circular-linear, circular-circular and linear-circular data is also possible via the adaptation of the classical Nadaraya-Watson and local linear estimators. In order to assess the significance of the features observed in the smooth curves, both for density and regression with a circular covariate and a linear response, a SiZer technique is developed for circular data, namely CircSiZer. Some data examples are also included in the package, jointly with a routine that allows generating mixtures of different circular distributions.","Random ferns is a very simple yet powerful classification method originally introduced for specific computer vision tasks. In this paper, I show that this algorithm may be considered as a constrained decision tree ensemble and use this interpretation to introduce a series of modifications which enable the use of random ferns in general machine learning problems. Moreover, I extend the method with an internal error approximation and an attribute importance measure based on corresponding features of the random forest algorithm. I also present the R package rFerns containing an efficient implementation of this modified version of random ferns.","Accelerated failure time (AFT) models are alternatives to relative risk models which are used extensively to examine the covariate effects on event times in censored data regression. Nevertheless, AFT models have been much less utilized in practice due to lack of reliable computing methods and software. This paper describes an R package aftgee that implements recently developed inference procedures for AFT models with both the rank-based approach and the least squares approach. For the rank-based approach, the package allows various weight choices and uses an induced smoothing procedure that leads to much more efficient computation than the linear programming method. With the rank-based estimator as an initial value, the generalized estimating equation approach is used as an extension of the least squares approach to the multivariate case. Additional sampling weights are incorporated to handle missing data needed as in case-cohort studies or general sampling schemes. A simulated dataset and two real life examples from biomedical research are employed to illustrate the usage of the package.","The BayesLCA package for R provides tools for performing latent class analysis within a Bayesian setting. Three methods for fitting the model are provided, incorporating an expectation-maximization algorithm, Gibbs sampling and a variational Bayes approximation. The article briefly outlines the methodology behind each of these techniques and discusses some of the technical difficulties associated with them. Methods to remedy these problems are also described. Visualization methods for each of these techniques are included, as well as criteria to aid model selection.","Time series clustering is an active research area with applications in a wide range of fields. One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity measure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to implement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.","The X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment program of the US Census Bureau extracts the different components (mainly: seasonal component, trend component, outlier component and irregular component) of a monthly or quarterly time series. It is the state-of-the- art technology for seasonal adjustment used in many statistical offices. It is possible to include a moving holiday effect, a trading day effect and user-defined regressors, and additionally incorporates automatic outlier detection. The procedure makes additive or multiplicative adjustments and creates an output data set containing the adjusted time series and intermediate calculations.\nThe original output from X-12-ARIMA is somehow static and it is not always an easy task for users to extract the required information for further processing. The R package x12 provides wrapper functions and an abstraction layer for batch processing of X-12-ARIMA. It allows summarizing, modifying and storing the output from X-12-ARIMA within a well-defined class-oriented implementation. On top of the class-oriented (command line) implementation the graphical user interface allows access to the R package x12 without requiring too much R knowledge. Users can interactively select additive outliers, level shifts and temporary changes and see the impact immediately.\nThe provision of the powerful X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment program available directly from within R, as well as of the new facilities for marking outliers, batch processing and change tracking, makes the package a potent and functional tool.","Parameter and structural learning on continuous time Bayesian network classifiers are challenging tasks when you are dealing with big data. This paper describes an efficient scalable parallel algorithm for parameter and structural learning in the case of complete data using the MapReduce framework. Two popular instances of classifiers are analyzed, namely the continuous time naive Bayes and the continuous time tree augmented naive Bayes. Details of the proposed algorithm are presented using Hadoop, an open-source implementation of a distributed file system and the MapReduce framework for distributed data processing. Performance evaluation of the designed algorithm shows a robust parallel scaling.","One major goal in clinical applications of multi-state models is the estimation of transition probabilities. The usual nonparametric estimator of the transition matrix for non-homogeneous Markov processes is the Aalen-Johansen estimator (Aalen and Johansen 1978). However, two problems may arise from using this estimator: first, its standard error may be large in heavy censored scenarios; second, the estimator may be inconsistent if the process is non-Markovian. The development of the R package TPmsm has been motivated by several recent contributions that account for these estimation problems. Estimation and statistical inference for transition probabilities can be performed using TPmsm. The TPmsm package provides seven different approaches to three-state illness-death modeling. In two of these approaches the transition probabilities are estimated conditionally on current or past covariate measures. Two real data examples are included for illustration of software usage.","We have developed the R package c060 with the aim of improving R software func- tionality for high-dimensional risk prediction modeling, e.g., for prognostic modeling of survival data using high-throughput genomic data. Penalized regression models provide a statistically appealing way of building risk prediction models from high-dimensional data. The popular CRAN package glmnet implements an efficient algorithm for fitting penalized Cox and generalized linear models. However, in practical applications the data analysis will typically not stop at the point where the model has been fitted. One is for example often interested in the stability of selected features and in assessing the prediction performance of a model and we provide functions to deal with both of these tasks. Our R functions are computationally efficient and offer the possibility of speeding up computing time through parallel computing. Another feature which can drastically reduce computing time is an efficient interval-search algorithm, which we have implemented for selecting the optimal parameter combination for elastic net penalties. These functions have been useful in our daily work at the Biostatistics department (C060) of the German Cancer Research Center where prognostic modeling of patient survival data is of particular interest. Although we focus on a survival data application of penalized Cox models in this article, the functions in our R package are in general applicable to all types of regression models implemented in the glmnet package, with the exception of prediction error curves, which are specific to time-to-event data.","This paper discusses the software D-STEM as a statistical tool for the analysis and mapping of environmental space-time variables. The software is based on a flexible hierarchical space-time model which is able to deal with multiple variables, heterogeneous spatial supports, heterogeneous sampling networks and missing data. Model estimation is based on the expectation maximization algorithm and it can be performed using a distributed computing environment to reduce computing time when dealing with large data sets. The estimated model is eventually used to dynamically map the variables over the geographic region of interest. Three examples of increasing complexity illustrate usage and capabilities of D-STEM, both in terms of modeling and implementation, starting from a univariate model and arriving at a multivariate data fusion with tapering.","There are many different ways in which change point analysis can be performed, from purely parametric methods to those that are distribution free. The ecp package is designed to perform multiple change point analysis while making as few assumptions as possible. While many other change point methods are applicable only for univariate data, this R package is suitable for both univariate and multivariate observations. Hierarchical estimation can be based upon either a divisive or agglomerative algorithm. Divisive estimation sequentially identifies change points via a bisection algorithm. The agglomerative algorithm estimates change point locations by determining an optimal segmentation. Both approaches are able to detect any type of distributional change within the data. This provides an advantage over many existing change point algorithms which are only able to detect changes within the marginal distributions.","Envelope models and methods represent new constructions that can lead to substantial increases in estimation efficiency in multivariate analyses. The envlp toolbox implements a variety of envelope estimators under the framework of multivariate linear regression, including the envelope model, partial envelope model, heteroscedastic envelope model, inner envelope model, scaled envelope model, and envelope model in the predictor space. The toolbox also implements the envelope model for estimating a multivariate mean. The capabilities of this toolbox include estimation of the model parameters, as well as performing standard multivariate inference in the context of envelope models; for example, prediction and prediction errors, F test for two nested models, the standard errors for contrasts or linear combinations of coefficients, and more. Examples and datasets are contained in the toolbox to illustrate the use of each model. All functions and datasets are documented.","Sequential Monte Carlo is a family of algorithms for sampling from a sequence of distributions. Some of these algorithms, such as particle filters, are widely used in physics and signal processing research. More recent developments have established their application in more general inference problems such as Bayesian modeling.\nThese algorithms have attracted considerable attention in recent years not only be- cause that they have desired statistical properties, but also because they admit natural and scalable parallelization. However, they are perceived to be difficult to implement. In addition, parallel programming is often unfamiliar to many researchers though conceptually appealing.\nA C++ template library is presented for the purpose of implementing generic sequential Monte Carlo algorithms on parallel hardware. Two examples are presented: a simple particle filter and a classic Bayesian modeling problem.","We give an overview of the papers published in this special issue on spatial statistics, of the Journal of Statistical Software. 21 papers address issues covering visualization (micromaps, links to Google Maps or Google Earth), point pattern analysis, geostatistics, analysis of areal aggregated or lattice data, spatio-temporal statistics, Bayesian spatial statistics, and Laplace approximations. We also point to earlier publications in this journal on the same topic.","The R package micromap is used to create linked micromaps, which display statistical summaries associated with areal units, or polygons. Linked micromaps provide a means to simultaneously summarize and display both statistical and geographic distributions by linking statistical summaries to a series of small maps. The package contains functions dependent on the ggplot2 package to produce a row-oriented graph composed of different panels, or columns, of information. These panels at a minimum typically contain maps, a legend, and statistical summaries, with the color-coded legend linking the maps and statistical summaries. We first describe the layout of linked micromaps and then the structure required for both the spatial and statistical datasets. The function create_map_table in the micromap package converts the input of an sp SpatialPolygonsDataFrame into a data frame that can be linked with the statistical dataset. Highly detailed polygons are not appropriate for display in linked micromaps so we describe how polygon boundaries can be simplified, decreasing the time required to draw the graphs, while retaining adequate detail for detection of spatial patterns. Our worked examples of linked micromaps use public health data as well as environmental data collected from spatially balanced probabilistic surveys.","plotKML is an R package that provides methods for writing the most common R spatial classes into KML files. It builds up on the existing XML parsing functionality (XML package), and provides similar plotting functionality as the lattice package. Its main objective is to provide a simple interface to generate KML files with a small number of arguments, and allows users to visually explore spatio-temporal data available in R: points, polygons, gridded maps, trajectory-type data, vertical profiles, ground photographs, time series vector objects or raster images, along with the results of spatial analysis such as geostatistical mapping, spatial simulations of vector and gridded objects, optimized sampling designs, species distribution models and similar. A generic plotKML() function automatically determines the parsing order and visualizes data directly from R; lower level functions can be combined to allow for new user-created visualization templates. In comparison to other packages writing KML, plotKML seems to be more object oriented, it links more closely to the existing R classes for spatio-temporal data (sp, spacetime and raster packages) than the alternatives, and provides users with the possibility to create their own templates.","ads is an R package that performs multi-scale spatial point pattern analyses through methods derived from Ripley's K-function. These methods apply to univariate, multivariate or marked point data mapped in a rectangular, circular or irregular-shaped sampling window. Specific tests of statistical significance based on Monte Carlo simulations are associated to these methods. The main features of ads is to call fast C subroutines for computing Ripley's unbiased local correction of edge effects for various sampling window configurations and for performing Monte Carlo simulations. It thus allows one to analyze large datasets and to compute robust confidence envelopes. This paper is an introduction to ads version 1.5, focusing on its complementarity with the other R packages for spatial point pattern analysis, and on recent original developments towards the introduction of multivariate functions for analyzing spatial pattern of species diversity.","Log-Gaussian Cox processes are an important class of models for spatial and spatiotemporal point-pattern data. Delivering robust Bayesian inference for this class of models presents a substantial challenge, since Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms require careful tuning in order to work well. To address this issue, we describe recent advances in MCMC methods for these models and their implementation in the R package lgcp. Our suite of R functions provides an extensible framework for inferring covariate effects as well as the parameters of the latent field. We also present methods for Bayesian inference in two further classes of model based on the log-Gaussian Cox process. The first of these concerns the case where we wish to fit a point process model to data consisting of event-counts aggregated to a set of spatial regions: we demonstrate how this can be achieved using data-augmentation. The second concerns Bayesian inference for a class of marked-point processes specified via a multivariate log-Gaussian Cox process model. For both of these extensions, we give details of their implementation in R.","Statistical analysis based on random fields has become a widely used approach in order to better understand real processes in many fields such as engineering, environmental sciences, etc. Data analysis based on random fields can be sometimes problematic to carry out from the inferential prospective. Examples are when dealing with: large dataset, counts or binary responses and extreme values data. This article explains how to perform, with the R package CompRandFld, challenging statistical analysis based on Gaussian, binary and max-stable random fields. The software provides tools for performing the statistical inference based on the composite likelihood in complex problems where standard likelihood methods are difficult to apply. The principal features are illustrated by means of simulation examples and an application of Irish daily wind speeds.","We consider parallel computation for Gaussian process calculations to overcome computational and memory constraints on the size of datasets that can be analyzed. Using a hybrid parallelization approach that uses both threading (shared memory) and message-passing (distributed memory), we implement the core linear algebra operations used in spatial statistics and Gaussian process regression in an R package called bigGP that relies on C and MPI. The approach divides the covariance matrix into blocks such that the computational load is balanced across processes while communication between processes is limited. The package provides an API enabling R programmers to implement Gaussian process-based methods by using the distributed linear algebra operations without any C or MPI coding. We illustrate the approach and software by analyzing an astrophysics dataset with n = 67, 275 observations.","In this paper we detail the reformulation and rewrite of core functions in the spBayes R package. These efforts have focused on improving computational efficiency, flexibility, and usability for point-referenced data models. Attention is given to algorithm and computing developments that result in improved sampler convergence rate and efficiency by reducing parameter space; decreased sampler run-time by avoiding expensive matrix computations, and; increased scalability to large datasets by implementing a class of predictive process models that attempt to overcome computational hurdles by representing spatial processes in terms of lower-dimensional realizations. Beyond these general computational improvements for existing model functions, we detail new functions for modeling data indexed in both space and time. These new functions implement a class of dynamic spatio-temporal models for settings where space is viewed as continuous and time is taken as discrete.","The R package spate implements methodology for modeling of large space-time data sets. A spatio-temporal Gaussian process is defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) which is solved using spectral methods. In contrast to the traditional geostatistical way of relying on the covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally tractable and provides a realistic space-time parametrization.\nThis package aims at providing tools for simulating and modeling of spatio-temporal processes using an SPDE based approach. The package contains functions for obtaining parametrizations, such as propagator or innovation covariance matrices, of the spatio-temporal model. This allows for building customized hierarchical Bayesian models using the SPDE based model at the process stage. The functions of the package then provide computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the hierarchical model. Furthermore, an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. This function is flexible and allows for application specific customizing. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero. Spatio-temporal covariates can be included in the model through a regression term.","Hierarchical Bayesian modeling of large point-referenced space-time data is increasingly becoming feasible in many environmental applications due to the recent advances in both statistical methodology and computation power. Implementation of these methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computational techniques, however, requires development of problem-specific and user-written computer code, possibly in a low-level language. This programming requirement is hindering the widespread use of the Bayesian model-based methods among practitioners and, hence there is an urgent need to develop high-level software that can analyze large data sets rich in both space and time. This paper develops the package spTimer for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of stylized environmental space-time monitoring data as a contributed software package in the R language that is fast becoming a very popular statistical computing platform. The package is able to fit, spatially and temporally predict large amounts of space-time data using three recently developed Bayesian models. The user is given control over many options regarding covariance function selection, distance calculation, prior selection and tuning of the implemented MCMC algorithms, although suitable defaults are provided. The package has many other attractive features such as on the fly transformations and an ability to spatially predict temporally aggregated summaries on the original scale, which saves the problem of storage when using MCMC methods for large datasets. A simulation example, with more than a million observations, and a real life data example are used to validate the underlying code and to illustrate the software capabilities.","Spatial cluster detection is a classical question in epidemiology: Are cases located near other cases? In order to classify a study area into zones of different risks and determine their boundaries, we have developed a spatial partitioning method based on oblique decision trees, which is called spatial oblique decision tree (SpODT). This non-parametric method is based on the classification and regression tree (CART) approach introduced by Leo Breiman. Applied to epidemiological spatial data, the algorithm recursively searches among the coordinates for a threshold or a boundary between zones, so that the risks estimated in these zones are as different as possible. While the CART algorithm leads to rectangular zones, providing perpendicular splits of longitudes and latitudes, the SpODT algorithm provides oblique splitting of the study area, which is more appropriate and accurate for spatial epidemiology. Oblique decision trees can be considered as non-parametric regression models. Beyond the basic function, we have developed a set of functions that enable extended analyses of spatial data, providing: inference, graphical representations, spatio-temporal analysis, adjustments on covariates, spatial weighted partition, and the gathering of similar adjacent final classes. In this paper, we propose a new R package, SPODT, which provides an extensible set of functions for partitioning spatial and spatio-temporal data. The implementation and extensions of the algorithm are described. Function usage examples are proposed, looking for clustering malaria episodes in Bandiagara, Mali, and samples showing three different cluster shapes.","Spatial statistics is a growing discipline providing important analytical techniques in a wide range of disciplines in the natural and social sciences. In the R package GWmodel we present techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics, termed geographically weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localized calibration provides a better description. The approach uses a moving window weighting technique, where localized models are found at target locations. Outputs are mapped to provide a useful exploratory tool into the nature of the data spatial heterogeneity. Currently, GWmodel includes functions for: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW regression, and GW discriminant analysis; some of which are provided in basic and robust forms.","Recent advances in the implementation of spatial econometrics model estimation techniques have made it desirable to compare results, which should correspond between implementations across software applications for the same data. These model estimation techniques are associated with methods for estimating impacts (emanating effects), which are also presented and compared. This review constitutes an up-to-date comparison of generalized method of moments and maximum likelihood implementations now available. The comparison uses the cross-sectional US county data set provided by Drukker, Prucha, and Raciborski (2013d). The comparisons will be cast in the context of alternatives using the MATLAB Spatial Econometrics toolbox, Stata's user-written sppack commands, Python with PySAL and R packages including spdep, sphet and McSpatial.","The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) provides an interesting way of approximating the posterior marginals of a wide range of Bayesian hierarchical models. This approximation is based on conducting a Laplace approximation of certain functions and numerical integration is extensively used to integrate some of the models parameters out.\nThe R-INLA package offers an interface to INLA, providing a suitable framework for data analysis. Although the INLA methodology can deal with a large number of models, only the most relevant have been implemented within R-INLA. However, many other important models are not available for R-INLA yet.\nIn this paper we show how to fit a number of spatial models with R-INLA, including its interaction with other R packages for data analysis. Secondly, we describe a novel method to extend the number of latent models available for the model parameters. Our approach is based on conditioning on one or several model parameters and fit these conditioned models with R-INLA. Then these models are combined using Bayesian model averaging to provide the final approximations to the posterior marginals of the model.\nFinally, we show some examples of the application of this technique in spatial statistics. It is worth noting that our approach can be extended to a number of other fields, and not only spatial statistics.","Chronic illness treatment strategies must adapt to the evolving health status of the patient receiving treatment. Data-driven dynamic treatment regimes can offer guidance for clinicians and intervention scientists on how to treat patients over time in order to bring about the most favorable clinical outcome on average. Methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment regimes, such as Q-learning, typically require modeling non- smooth, nonmonotone transformations of data. Thus, building well-fitting models can be challenging and in some cases may result in a poor estimate of the optimal treatment regime. Interactive Q-learning (IQ-learning) is an alternative to Q-learning that only requires modeling smooth, monotone transformations of the data. The R package iqLearn provides functions for implementing both the IQ-learning and Q-learning algorithms. We demonstrate how to estimate a two-stage optimal treatment policy with iqLearn using a generated data set bmiData which mimics a two-stage randomized body mass index reduction trial with binary treatments at each stage.","Over the last few years, the power law distribution has been used as the data generating mechanism in many disparate fields. However, at times the techniques used to fit the power law distribution have been inappropriate. This paper describes the poweRlaw R package, which makes fitting power laws and other heavy-tailed distributions straightforward. This package contains R functions for fitting, comparing and visualizing heavy tailed distributions. Overall, it provides a principled approach to power law fitting.","Testing genetic markers for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is an important issue in genetic association studies. The HardyWeinberg package offers the classical tests for equilibrium, functions for power computation and for the simulation of marker data under equilibrium and disequilibrium. Functions for testing equilibrium in the presence of missing data by using multiple imputation are provided. The package also supplies various graphical tools such as ternary plots with acceptance regions, log-ratio plots and Q-Q plots for exploring the equilibrium status of a large set of diallelic markers. Classical tests for equilibrium and graphical representations for diallelic marker data are reviewed. Several data sets illustrate the use of the package.","The package fitdistrplus provides functions for fitting univariate distributions to different types of data (continuous censored or non-censored data and discrete data) and allowing different estimation methods (maximum likelihood, moment matching, quantile matching and maximum goodness-of-fit estimation). Outputs of fitdist and fitdistcens functions are S3 objects, for which specific methods are provided, including summary, plot and quantile. This package also provides various functions to compare the fit of several distributions to the same data set and can handle to bootstrap parameter estimates. Detailed examples are given in food risk assessment, ecotoxicology and insurance contexts.","NHPoisson is an R package for the modeling of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes in one dimension. It includes functions for data preparation, maximum likelihood estimation, covariate selection and inference based on asymptotic distributions and simulation methods. It also provides specific methods for the estimation of Poisson processes resulting from a peak over threshold approach. In addition, the package supports a wide range of model validation tools and functions for generating nonhomogenous Poisson process trajectories. This paper is a description of the package and aims to help those interested in modeling data using nonhomogeneous Poisson processes.","PReMiuM is a recently developed R package for Bayesian clustering using a Dirichlet process mixture model. This model is an alternative to regression models, non- parametrically linking a response vector to covariate data through cluster membership (Molitor, Papathomas, Jerrett, and Richardson 2010). The package allows binary, categorical, count and continuous response, as well as continuous and discrete covariates. Additionally, predictions may be made for the response, and missing values for the covariates are handled. Several samplers and label switching moves are implemented along with diagnostic tools to assess convergence. A number of R functions for post-processing of the output are also provided. In addition to fitting mixtures, it may additionally be of interest to determine which covariates actively drive the mixture components. This is implemented in the package as variable selection.","The R package multgee implements the local odds ratios generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach proposed by Touloumis, Agresti, and Kateri (2013), a GEE approach for correlated multinomial responses that circumvents theoretical and practical limitations of the GEE method. A main strength of multgee is that it provides GEE routines for both ordinal (ordLORgee) and nominal (nomLORgee) responses, while relevant other softwares in R and SAS are restricted to ordinal responses under a marginal cumulative link model specification. In addition, multgee offers a marginal adjacent categories logit model for ordinal responses and a marginal baseline category logit model for nominal responses. Further, utility functions are available to ease the local odds ratios structure selection (intrinsic.pars) and to perform a Wald type goodness-of-fit test between two nested GEE models (waldts). We demonstrate the application of multgee through a clinical trial with clustered ordinal multinomial responses.","One-way layouts, i.e., a single factor with several levels and multiple observations at each level, frequently arise in various fields. Usually not only a global hypothesis is of interest but also multiple comparisons between the different treatment levels. In most practical situations, the distribution of observed data is unknown and there may exist a number of atypical measurements and outliers. Hence, use of parametric and semiparametric procedures that impose restrictive distributional assumptions on observed samples becomes questionable. This, in turn, emphasizes the demand on statistical procedures that enable us to accurately and reliably analyze one-way layouts with minimal conditions on available data. Nonparametric methods offer such a possibility and thus become of particular practical importance. In this article, we introduce a new R  package nparcomp which provides an easy and user-friendly access to rank-based methods for the analysis of unbalanced one-way layouts. It provides procedures performing multiple comparisons and computing simultaneous confidence intervals for the estimated effects which can be easily visualized. The special case of two samples, the nonparametric Behrens-Fisher problem, is included. We illustrate the implemented procedures by examples from biology and medicine.","Mathematical models of disease progression predict disease outcomes and are useful epidemiological tools for planners and evaluators of health interventions. The R package gems is a tool that simulates disease progression in patients and predicts the effect of different interventions on patient outcome. Disease progression is represented by a series of events (e.g., diagnosis, treatment and death), displayed in a directed acyclic graph. The vertices correspond to disease states and the directed edges represent events. The package gems allows simulations based on a generalized multistate model that can be described by a directed acyclic graph with continuous transition-specific hazard functions. The user can specify an arbitrary hazard function and its parameters. The model includes parameter uncertainty, does not need to be a Markov model, and may take the history of previous events into account. Applications are not limited to the medical field and extend to other areas where multistate simulation is of interest. We provide a technical explanation of the multistate models used by gems, explain the functions of gems and their arguments, and show a sample application.","Gaussian process (GP) models are commonly used statistical metamodels for emulating expensive computer simulators. Fitting a GP model can be numerically unstable if any pair of design points in the input space are close together. Ranjan, Haynes, and Karsten (2011) proposed a computationally stable approach for fitting GP models to deterministic computer simulators. They used a genetic algorithm based approach that is robust but computationally intensive for maximizing the likelihood. This paper implements a slightly modified version ofthe model proposed by Ranjan et al.  (2011 ) in the R  package GPfit. A novel parameterization of the spatial correlation function and a clustering based multi-start gradient based optimization algorithm yield robust optimization that is typically faster than the genetic algorithm based approach. We present two examples with R  codes to illustrate the usage of the main functions in GPfit . Several test functions are used for performance comparison with the popular R  package mlegp . We also use GPfit  for a real application, i.e., for emulating the tidal kinetic energy model for the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada. GPfit  is free software and distributed under the General Public License and available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.","This paper introduces the R package SAVE which implements statistical methodology for the analysis of computer models. Namely, the package includes routines that perform emulation, calibration and validation of this type of models. The methodology is Bayesian and is essentially that of Bayarri, Berger, Paulo, Sacks, Cafeo, Cavendish, Lin, and Tu (2007). The package is available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network. We illustrate its use with a real data example and in the context of a simulated example.","The R package groc for generalized regression on orthogonal components contains functions for the prediction of q responses using a set of p predictors. The primary building block is the grid algorithm used to search for components (projections of the data) which are most dependent on the response. The package offers flexibility in the choice of the dependence measure which can be user-defined. The components are found sequentially. A first component is obtained and a smooth fit produces residuals. Then, a second component orthogonal to the first is found which is most dependent on the residuals, and so on. The package can handle models with more than one response. A panoply of models can be achieved through package groc: robust multiple or multivariate linear regression, nonparametric regression on orthogonal components, and classical or robust partial least squares models. Functions for predictions and cross-validation are available and helpful in model selection. The merit of a fit through cross-validation can be assessed with the predicted residual error sum of squares or the predicted residual error median absolute deviation which is more appropriate in the presence of outliers.","Since the seminal work of Tukey (1975), depth functions have proved extremely useful in robust data analysis and inference for multivariate data. Many notions of depth have been developed in the last decades. Among others, projection depth appears to be very favorable. It turns out that (Zuo 2003 ; Zuo, Cui, and He 2004; Zuo 2006), with appropriate choices of univariate location and scale estimators, the projection depth induced estimators usually possess very high breakdown point robustness and infinite sample relative efficiency. However, the computation of the projection depth seems hopeless and intimidating if not impossible. This hinders the further inference procedures development in practice. Sporadically algorithms exist in individual papers, though an unified computation package for projection depth has not been documented. To fill the gap, a MATLAB  package entitled CompPD is presented in this paper, which is in fact an implementation of the latest developments (Liu, Zuo, and Wang 2013; Liu and Zuo 2014). Illustrative examples are also provided to guide readers through step-by-step usage of package CompPD to demonstrate its utility.","The R  package simPH  provides tools for effectively communicating results from Cox proportional hazard (PH) models, including models with interactive and nonlinear effects. The Cox (PH) model is a popular tool for examining event data. However, previously available computational tools have not made it easy to explore and communicate quantities of interest and associated uncertainty estimated from them. This is especially true when the effects are interactions or nonlinear transformations of continuous variables. These transformations are especially useful with Cox PH models because they can be employed to correctly specifying models that would otherwise violate the nonproportional hazards assumption. Package simPH  makes it easy to simulate and then plot quantities of interest for a variety of effects estimated from Cox PH models including interactive effects, nonlinear effects, as well as standard linear effects. Package simPH  employs visual weighting in order to effectively communicate estimation uncertainty. There are options to show either the standard central interval of the simulation's distribution or the shortest probability interval - which can be useful for asymmetrically distributed estimates. This paper uses hypothetical and empirical examples to illustrate package simPH 's syntax and capabilities.","It is well known that using individual covariate information (such as body weight or gender) to model heterogeneity in capture-recapture (CR) experiments can greatly enhance inferences on the size of a closed population. Since individual covariates are only observable for captured individuals, complex conditional likelihood methods are usually required and these do not constitute a standard generalized linear model (GLM) family. Modern statistical techniques such as generalized additive models (GAMs), which allow a relaxing of the linearity assumptions on the covariates, are readily available for many standard GLM families. Fortunately, a natural statistical framework for maximizing conditional likelihoods is available in the Vector GLM and Vector GAM classes of models. We present several new R functions (implemented within the VGAM package) specifically developed to allow the incorporation of individual covariates in the analysis of closed population CR data using a GLM/GAM-like approach and the conditional likelihood. As a result, a wide variety of practical tools are now readily available in the VGAM object oriented framework. We discuss and demonstrate their advantages, features and flexibility using the new VGAM CR functions on several examples.","Fuzzy rule-based systems (FRBSs) are a well-known method family within soft computing. They are based on fuzzy concepts to address complex real-world problems. We present the R package frbs which implements the most widely used FRBS models, namely, Mamdani and Takagi Sugeno Kang (TSK) ones, as well as some common variants. In addition a host of learning methods for FRBSs, where the models are constructed from data, are implemented. In this way, accurate and interpretable systems can be built for data analysis and modeling tasks. In this paper, we also provide some examples on the usage of the package and a comparison with other common classification and regression methods available in R.","Sequentially randomized designs, more recently known as sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designs, are widely used in biomedical research, particularly in clinical trials, to assess and compare the effects of various treatment sequences. In such designs, patients are initially randomized to one of the rst-stage therapies. Then patients meeting some criteria (e.g., no relapse of disease) participate in the second-stage randomization to one of the second-stage therapies. The advantage of such a design is that it allows the investigator to study various treatment sequences where the patients' second-stage therapies can be adjusted based on their responses to the rst-stage therapies. In the past few years, substantial improvement has been made in the statistical methods for analyzing the data from SMARTs. Much of the proposed statistical approaches focus on estimating and comparing the survival outcomes of treatment sequences embedded in the SMART designs. In this article, we introduce the R package DTR, which provides a set of functions that can be used to estimate and compare the effects of different treatment sequences on survival outcomes using the newly proposed statistical approaches. The proposed package is also illustrated using simulated data from SMARTs.","In this article, we present PCovR, an R package for performing principal covariates regression (PCovR; De Jong and Kiers 1992). PCovR was developed for analyzing regression data with many and/or highly collinear predictor variables. The method simultaneously reduces the predictor variables to a limited number of components and regresses the criterion variables on these components. The flexibility, interpretational advantages, and computational simplicity of PCovR make the method stand out between many other regression methods. The PCovR package offers data preprocessing options, new model selection procedures, and several component rotation strategies, some of which were not available in R up till now. The use and usefulness of the package is illustrated with a real dataset, called psychiatrists.","We present the R package gMWT which is designed for the comparison of several treatments (or groups) for a large number of variables. The comparisons are made using certain probabilistic indices (PI). The PIs computed here tell how often pairs or triples of observations coming from different groups appear in a specific order of magnitude. Classical two and several sample rank test statistics such as the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon, Kruskal-Wallis, or Jonckheere-Terpstra test statistics are simple functions of these PI. Also new test statistics for directional alternatives are provided. The package gMWT can be used to calculate the variable-wise PI estimates, to illustrate their multivariate distribution and mutual dependence with joint scatterplot matrices, and to construct several classical and new rank tests based on the PIs. The aim of the paper is first to briefly explain the theory that is necessary to understand the behavior of the estimated PIs and the rank tests based on them. Second, the use of the package is described and illustrated with simulated and real data examples. It is stressed that the package provides a new flexible toolbox to analyze large gene or microRNA expression data sets, collected on microarrays or by other high-throughput technologies. The testing procedures can be used in an eQTL analysis, for example, as implemented in the package GeneticTools.","This paper introduces two R packages available on the Comprehensive R Archive network. The main application concerns the study of computer code output. Package DiceDesign is dedicated to numerical design of experiments, from the construction to the study of the design properties. Package DiceEval deals with the fit, the validation and the comparison of metamodels. After a brief presentation of the context, we focus on the architecture of these two packages. A two-dimensional test function will be a running example to illustrate the main functionalities of these packages and an industrial case study in five dimensions will also be detailed.","Exponential-family random graph models are probabilistic network models that are parametrized by sufficient statistics based on structural (i.e., graph-theoretic) properties. The ergm package for the R statistical computing environment is a collection of tools for the analysis of network data within an exponential-family random graph model framework. Many different network properties can be employed as sufficient statistics for exponential- family random graph models by using the model terms defined in the ergm package; this functionality can be expanded by the creation of packages that code for additional network statistics. Here, our focus is on the addition of statistics based on graphlets. Graphlets are classes of small, connected, induced subgraphs that can be used to describe the topological structure of a network. We introduce an R package called ergm.graphlets that enables the use of graphlet properties of a network within the ergm package of R. The ergm.graphlets package provides a complete list of model terms that allows to incorporate statistics of any 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-node graphlets into exponential-family random graph models. The new model terms of the ergm.graphlets package enable both exponential-family random graph modeling of global structural properties and investigation of relationships between node attributes (i.e., covariates) and local topologies around nodes.","Response-adaptive randomization designs are becoming increasingly popular in clinical trial practice. In this paper, we present RARtool, a user interface software developed in MATLAB for designing response-adaptive randomized comparative clinical trials with censored time-to-event outcomes. The RARtool software can compute different types of optimal treatment allocation designs, and it can simulate response-adaptive randomization procedures targeting selected optimal allocations. Through simulations, an investigator can assess design characteristics under a variety of experimental scenarios and select the best procedure for practical implementation. We illustrate the utility of our RARtool software by redesigning a survival trial from the literature.","The change point model framework introduced in Hawkins, Qiu, and Kang (2003) and Hawkins and Zamba (2005a) provides an effective and computationally efficient method for detecting multiple mean or variance change points in sequences of Gaussian random variables, when no prior information is available regarding the parameters of the distribution in the various segments. It has since been extended in various ways by Hawkins and Deng (2010), Ross, Tasoulis, and Adams (2011), Ross and Adams (2012) to allow for fully nonparametric change detection in non-Gaussian sequences, when no knowledge is available regarding even the distributional form of the sequence. Another extension comes from Ross and Adams (2011) and Ross (2014) which allows change detection in streams of Bernoulli and Exponential random variables respectively, again when the values of the parameters are unknown.\nThis paper describes the R package cpm, which provides a fast implementation of all the above change point models in both batch (Phase I) and sequential (Phase II) settings, where the sequences may contain either a single or multiple change points.","In the psychometric literature, item response theory models have been proposed that explicitly take the decision process underlying the responses of subjects to psychometric test items into account. Application of these models is however hampered by the absence of general and flexible software to fit these models. In this paper, we present diffIRT, an R package that can be used to fit item response theory models that are based on a diffusion process. We discuss parameter estimation and model fit assessment, show the viability of the package in a simulation study, and illustrate the use of the package with two datasets pertaining to extraversion and mental rotation. In addition, we illustrate how the package can be used to fit the traditional diffusion model (as it has been originally developed in experimental psychology) to data.","Nonlinear regression models are applied in a broad variety of scientific fields. Various R functions are already dedicated to fitting such models, among which the function nls() has a prominent position. Unlike linear regression fitting of nonlinear models relies on non-trivial assumptions and therefore users are required to carefully ensure and validate the entire modeling. Parameter estimation is carried out using some variant of the least- squares criterion involving an iterative process that ideally leads to the determination of the optimal parameter estimates. Therefore, users need to have a clear understanding of the model and its parameterization in the context of the application and data considered, an a priori idea about plausible values for parameter estimates, knowledge of model diagnostics procedures available for checking crucial assumptions, and, finally, an under- standing of the limitations in the validity of the underlying hypotheses of the fitted model and its implication for the precision of parameter estimates. Current nonlinear regression modules lack dedicated diagnostic functionality. So there is a need to provide users with an extended toolbox of functions enabling a careful evaluation of nonlinear regression fits. To this end, we introduce a unified diagnostic framework with the R package nlstools. In this paper, the various features of the package are presented and exemplified using a worked example from pulmonary medicine.","The measurement and reporting of model error is of basic importance when constructing models. Here, a general method and an R package, A3, are presented to support the assessment and communication of the quality of a model fit along with metrics of variable importance. The presented method is accurate, robust, and adaptable to a wide range of predictive modeling algorithms. The method is described along with case studies and a usage guide. It is shown how the method can be used to obtain more accurate models for prediction and how this may simultaneously lead to altered inferences and conclusions about the impact of potential drivers within a system.","Implementation of multivariate and 2D extensions of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) by means of the R package Rssa is considered. The extensions include MSSA for simultaneous analysis and forecasting of several time series and 2D-SSA for analysis of digital images. A new extension of 2D-SSA analysis called shaped 2D-SSA is introduced for analysis of images of arbitrary shape, not necessary rectangular. It is shown that implementation of shaped 2D-SSA can serve as a basis for implementation of MSSA and other generalizations. Efficient implementation of operations with Hankel and Hankel-block-Hankel matrices through the fast Fourier transform is suggested. Examples with code fragments in R, which explain the methodology and demonstrate the proper use of Rssa, are presented.","This paper introduces the R package twostageTE for estimation of an inverse regression function at a given point when one can sample an explanatory covariate at different values and measure the corresponding responses. The package implements a number of nonparametric methods for budget constrained threshold value estimation. Specifically, it contains methods for classical one-stage designs and also adaptive two-stage designs, which have been shown to yield more efficient and accurate results. A major advantage of the methods in package twostageTE is that threshold value estimation is performed without penalization or kernel smoothing, and hence, avoids the well-known problems of choosing the corresponding tuning parameter (regularization, bandwidth). The user can easily perform a two-stage analysis with twostageTE by (i) identifying the second stage sampling region from an initial sample, and (ii) computing various types of confidence intervals to ensure a robust analysis. The package twostageTE is illustrated through simulated examples.","The demand for data from surveys, censuses or registers containing sensible information on people or enterprises has increased significantly over the last years. However, before data can be provided to the public or to researchers, confidentiality has to be respected for any data set possibly containing sensible information about individual units. Confidentiality can be achieved by applying statistical disclosure control (SDC) methods to the data in order to decrease the disclosure risk of data.The R package sdcMicro serves as an easy-to-handle, object-oriented S4 class implementation of SDC methods to evaluate and anonymize confidential micro-data sets. It includes all popular disclosure risk and perturbation methods. The package performs automated recalculation of frequency counts, individual and global risk measures, information loss and data utility statistics after each anonymization step. All methods are highly optimized in terms of computational costs to be able to work with large data sets. Reporting facilities that summarize the anonymization process can also be easily used by practitioners. We describe the package and demonstrate its functionality with a complex household survey test data set that has been distributed by the International Household Survey Network.","Permutation distribution clustering is a complexity-based approach to clustering time series. The dissimilarity of time series is formalized as the squared Hellinger distance between the permutation distribution of embedded time series. The resulting distance measure has linear time complexity, is invariant to phase and monotonic transformations, and robust to outliers. A probabilistic interpretation allows the determination of the number of significantly different clusters. An entropy-based heuristic relieves the user of the need to choose the parameters of the underlying time-delayed embedding manually and, thus, makes it possible to regard the approach as parameter-free. This approach is illustrated with examples on empirical data.","Mixmod is a well-established software package for fitting mixture models of multivariate Gaussian or multinomial probability distribution functions to a given dataset with either a clustering, a density estimation or a discriminant analysis purpose. The Rmixmod S4 package provides an interface from the R statistical computing environment to the C++ core library of Mixmod (mixmodLib). In this article, we give an overview of the model-based clustering and classification methods implemented, and we show how the R package Rmixmod can be used for clustering and discriminant analysis.","We review the theory and application of generalized linear autoregressive moving average observation-driven models for time series of counts with explanatory variables and describe the estimation of these models using the R package glarma. Forecasting, diagnostic and graphical methods are also illustrated by several examples.","entropart is a package for R designed to estimate diversity based on HCDT entropy or similarity-based entropy. It allows calculating species-neutral, phylogenetic and functional entropy and diversity, partitioning them and correcting them for estimation bias.","Kawaguchi, Koch, and Wang (2011) provide methodology and applications for a stratified Mann-Whitney estimator that addresses the same comparison between two randomized groups for a strictly ordinal response variable as the van Elteren test statistic for randomized clinical trials with strata. The sanon package provides the implementation of the method within the R programming environment. The usage of sanon is illustrated with five examples. The first example is a randomized clinical trial with eight strata and a univariate ordinal response variable. The second example is a randomized clinical trial with four strata, two covariables, and four ordinal response variables. The third example is a crossover design randomized clinical trial with two strata, one covariable, and two ordinal response variables. The fourth example is a randomized clinical trial with seven strata (which are managed as a categorical covariable), three ordinal covariables with missing values, and three ordinal response variables with missing values. The fifth example is a randomized clinical trial with six strata, a categorical covariable with three levels, and three ordinal response variables with missing values.","LibBi is a software package for state space modelling and Bayesian inference on modern computer hardware, including multi-core central processing units, many-core graphics processing units, and distributed-memory clusters of such devices. The software parses a domain-specific language for model specification, then optimizes, generates, compiles and runs code for the given model, inference method and hardware platform. In presenting the software, this work serves as an introduction to state space models and the specialized methods developed for Bayesian inference with them. The focus is on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods such as the particle filter for state estimation, and the particle Markov chain Monte Carlo and SMC2 methods for parameter estimation. All are well-suited to current computer hardware. Two examples are given and developed throughout, one a linear three-element windkessel model of the human arterial system, the other a nonlinear Lorenz '96 model. These are specified in the prescribed modelling language, and LibBi demonstrated by performing inference with them. Empirical results are presented, including a performance comparison of the software with different hardware configurations.","Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.","Spatial microsimulation is a methodology aiming to simulate entities such as households, individuals or businesses in the finest possible scale. This process requires the use of individual based microdatasets. The package presented in this work facilitates the production of small area population microdata by combining various datasets such as census data and individual based datasets. This package includes a parallel implementation of random selection with optimization to select a group of individual records that match a macro description. This methodological approach has been used in a number of topics ranging from measuring inequalities in educational attainment (Kavroudakis, Ballas, and Birkin 2012) to estimating poverty at small area levels (Tanton, McNamara, Harding, and Morrison 2007). The development of the method over recent years is driving computational complexity to the edge as it uses modern computational approaches for the combination of data. The R package sms presented in this work uses parallel processing approaches for the efficient production of small area population microdata, which can be subsequently used for geographical analysis. Finally, a complete case study of fitting geographical data with the R package is presented and discussed.","This article describes the BMS (Bayesian model sampling) package for R that implements Bayesian model averaging for linear regression models. The package excels in allowing for a variety of prior structures, among them the \"binomial-beta\" prior on the model space and the so-called \"hyper-g\" specifications for Zellner's g prior. Furthermore, the BMS package allows the user to specify her own model priors and offers a possibility of subjective inference by setting \"prior inclusion probabilities\" according to the researcher's beliefs. Furthermore, graphical analysis of results is provided by numerous built-in plot functions of posterior densities, predictive densities and graphical illustrations to compare results under different prior settings. Finally, the package provides full enumeration of the model space for small scale problems as well as two efficient MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) samplers that sort through the model space when the number of potential covariates is large.","This paper presents a software package that implements Bayesian model averaging for gretl, the GNU regression, econometrics and time-series library. Bayesian model averaging is a model-building strategy that takes account of model uncertainty in conclusions about estimated parameters. It is an efficient tool for discovering the most probable models and obtaining estimates of their posterior characteristics. In recent years we have observed an increasing number of software packages devoted to Bayesian model averaging for different statistical and econometric software. In this paper, we propose the BMA package for gretl, which is an increasingly popular free, open-source software for econometric analysis with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. We introduce the BMA package for linear regression models with jointness measures proposed by Ley and Steel (2007) and Doppelhofer and Weeks (2009).","We describe the R package CovSel, which reduces the dimension of the covariate vector for the purpose of estimating an average causal effect under the unconfoundedness assumption. Covariate selection algorithms developed in De Luna, Waernbaum, and Richardson (2011) are implemented using model-free backward elimination. We show how to use the package to select minimal sets of covariates. The package can be used with continuous and discrete covariates and the user can choose between marginal co-ordinate hypothesis tests and kernel-based smoothing as model-free dimension reduction techniques.","This paper presents the MATLAB package DeCo (density combination) which is based on the paper by Billio, Casarin, Ravazzolo, and van Dijk (2013) where a constructive Bayesian approach is presented for combining predictive densities originating from different models or other sources of information. The combination weights are time-varying and may depend on past predictive forecasting performances and other learning mechanisms. The core algorithm is the function DeCo which applies banks of parallel sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to filter the time-varying combination weights. The DeCo procedure has been implemented both for standard CPU computing and for graphical process unit (GPU) parallel computing. For the GPU implementation we use the MATLAB parallel computing toolbox and show how to use general purpose GPU computing almost effortlessly. This GPU implementation provides a speed-up of the execution time of up to seventy times on a standard CPU MATLAB implementation on a multicore CPU. We show the use of the package and the computational gain of the GPU version through some simulation experiments and empirical applications.","Missing values are common in data, and usually require attention in order to conduct the statistical analysis. One of the first steps is to explore the structure of the missing values, and how missingness relates to the other collected variables. This article describes an R package, that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to help explore the missing data structure and to examine the results of different imputation methods. The GUI provides numerical and graphical summaries conditional on missingness, and includes imputations using fixed values, multiple imputations and nearest neighbors.","The R package equateIRT implements item response theory (IRT) methods for equating different forms composed of dichotomous items. In particular, the IRT models included are the three-parameter logistic model, the two-parameter logistic model, the one-parameter logistic model and the Rasch model. Forms can be equated when they present common items (direct equating) or when they can be linked through a chain of forms that present common items in pairs (indirect or chain equating). When two forms can be equated through different paths, a single conversion can be obtained by averaging the equating coefficients. The package calculates direct and chain equating coefficients. The averaging of direct and chain coefficients that link the same two forms is performed through the bisector method. Furthermore, the package provides analytic standard errors of direct, chain and average equating coefficients.","Pattern-mixture models have gained considerable interest in recent years. Patternmixture modeling allows the analysis of incomplete longitudinal outcomes under a variety of missingness mechanisms. In this manuscript, we describe a SAS program which combines R functionalities to fit pattern-mixture models, considering the cases that missingness mechanisms are at random and not at random. Patterns are defined based on missingness at every time point and parameter estimation is based on a full group-bytime interaction. The program implements a multiple imputation method under so-called identifying restrictions. The code is illustrated using data from a placebo-controlled clinical trial. This manuscript and the program are directed to SAS users with minimal knowledge of the R language.","The software POPS performs inference of population genetic structure using multilocus genotypic data. Based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework for latent regression models, POPS implements algorithms that improve estimation of individual admixture proportions and cluster membership probabilities by using geographic and environmental information. In addition, POPS defines ancestry distribution models allowing its users to forecast admixture proportion and cluster membership geographic variation under changing environmental conditions. We illustrate a typical use of POPS using data for an alpine plant species, for which POPS predicts changes in spatial population structure assuming a particular scenario of climate change.","The analysis of interaction effects involving genetic variants and environmental exposures on the risk of adverse obstetric and early-life outcomes is generally performed using standard logistic regression in the case-mother and control-mother design. However such an analysis is inefficient because it does not take into account the natural family-based constraints present in the parent-child relationship. Recently, a new approach based on semi-parametric maximum likelihood estimation was proposed. The advantage of this approach is that it takes into account the parental relationship between the mother and her child in estimation. But a package implementing this method has not been widely available. In this paper, we present SPmlficmcm, an R package implementing this new method and we propose an extension of the method to handle missing offspring genotype data by maximum likelihood estimation. Our choice to treat missing data of the offspring genotype was motivated by the fact that in genetic association studies where the genetic data of mother and child are available, there are usually more missing data on the genotype of the offspring than that of the mother. The package builds a non-linear system from the data and solves and computes the estimates from the gradient and the Hessian matrix of the log profile semi-parametric likelihood function. Finally, we analyze a simulated dataset to show the usefulness of the package.","Least-squares means are predictions from a linear model, or averages thereof. They are useful in the analysis of experimental data for summarizing the effects of factors, and for testing linear contrasts among predictions. The lsmeans package (Lenth 2016) provides a simple way of obtaining least-squares means and contrasts thereof. It supports many models fitted by R (R Core Team 2015) core packages (as well as a few key contributed ones) that fit linear or mixed models, and provides a simple way of extending it to cover more model classes.","Technological advances in molecular biology over the past decade have given rise to high dimensional and complex datasets offering the possibility to investigate biological associations between a range of genomic features and complex phenotypes. The analysis of this novel type of data generated unprecedented computational challenges which ultimately led to the definition and implementation of computationally efficient statistical models that were able to scale to genome-wide data, including Bayesian variable selection approaches. While extensive methodological work has been carried out in this area, only few methods capable of handling hundreds of thousands of predictors were implemented and distributed. Among these we recently proposed GUESS, a computationally optimised algorithm making use of graphics processing unit capabilities, which can accommodate multiple outcomes. In this paper we propose R2GUESS, an R package wrapping the original C++ source code. In addition to providing a user-friendly interface of the original code automating its parametrisation, and data handling, R2GUESS also incorporates many features to explore the data, to extend statistical inferences from the native algorithm (e.g., effect size estimation, significance assessment), and to visualize outputs from the algorithm. We first detail the model and its parametrisation, and describe in details its optimised implementation. Based on two examples we finally illustrate its statistical performances and flexibility.","The PoweR package aims to help obtain or verify empirical power studies for goodnessof-fit tests for independent and identically distributed data. The current version of our package is only valid for simple null hypotheses or for pivotal test statistics for which the set of critical values does not depend on a particular choice of a null distribution (and on nuisance parameters) under the non-simple null case. We also assume that the distribution of the test statistic is continuous. As a reproducible research computational tool it can be viewed as helping to simply reproducing (or detecting errors in) simulation results already published in the literature. Using our package helps also in designing new simulation studies. The empirical levels and powers for many statistical test statistics under a wide variety of alternative distributions can be obtained quickly and accurately using a C/C++ and R environment. The parallel package can be used to parallelize computations when a multicore processor is available. The results can be displayed using LATEX tables or specialized graphs, which can be directly incorporated into a report. This article gives an overview of the main design aims and principles of our package, as well as strategies for adaptation and extension. Hands-on illustrations are presented to help new users in getting started.","It is shown how to set up, conduct, and analyze large simulation studies with the new R package simsalapar (= simulations simplified and launched parallel). A simulation study typically starts with determining a collection of input variables and their values on which the study depends. Computations are desired for all combinations of these variables. If conducting these computations sequentially is too time-consuming, parallel computing can be applied over all combinations of select variables. The final result object of a simulation study is typically an array. From this array, summary statistics can be derived and presented in terms of flat contingency or LATEX tables or visualized in terms of matrix-like figures. The R package simsalapar provides several tools to achieve the above tasks. Warnings and errors are dealt with correctly, various seeding methods are available, and run time is measured. Furthermore, tools for analyzing the results via tables or graphics are provided. In contrast to rather minimal examples typically found in R packages or vignettes, an end-to-end, not-so-minimal simulation problem from the realm of quantitative risk management is given. The concepts presented and solutions provided by simsalapar may be of interest to students, researchers, and practitioners as a how-to for conducting realistic, large-scale simulation studies in R.","The R package stochvol provides a fully Bayesian implementation of heteroskedasticity modeling within the framework of stochastic volatility. It utilizes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers to conduct inference by obtaining draws from the posterior distribution of parameters and latent variables which can then be used for predicting future volatilities. The package can straightforwardly be employed as a stand-alone tool; moreover, it allows for easy incorporation into other MCMC samplers. The main focus of this paper is to show the functionality of stochvol. In addition, it provides a brief mathematical description of the model, an overview of the sampling schemes used, and several illustrative examples using exchange rate data.","This article describes the R package CountsEPPM and its use in determining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of extended Poisson process models. These provide a Poisson process based family of flexible models that can handle both underdispersion and overdispersion in observed count data, with the negative binomial and Poisson distributions being special cases. Within CountsEPPM models with mean and variance related to covariates are constructed to match a generalized linear model formulation. Use of the package is illustrated by application to several published datasets.","basicspace is an R package that conducts Aldrich-McKelvey and Blackbox scaling to recover estimates of the underlying latent dimensions of issue scale data. We illustrate several applications of the package to survey data commonly used in the social sciences. Monte Carlo tests demonstrate that the procedure can recover latent dimensions and reproduce the matrix of responses at moderate levels of error and missing data.","The predictive value of a statistical model can often be improved by applying shrinkage methods. This can be achieved, e.g., by regularized regression or empirical Bayes approaches. Various types of shrinkage factors can also be estimated after a maximum likelihood fit has been obtained: while global shrinkage modifies all regression coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage factors differ between regression coefficients. The latter ones have been proposed especially in the context of variable selection. With variables which are either highly correlated or associated with regard to contents, such as dummy variables coding a categorical variable, or several parameters describing a nonlinear effect, parameterwise shrinkage factors may not be the best choice. For such cases, we extend the present methodology by so-called 'joint shrinkage factors', a compromise between global and parameterwise shrinkage. Shrinkage factors are often estimated using leave-one-out resampling. We also discuss a computationally simple and much faster approximation to resampling-based shrinkage factor estimation, can be easily obtained in most standard software packages for regression analyses. This alternative may be relevant for simulation studies and other computerintensive investigations. Furthermore, we provide an R package shrink implementing the mentioned shrinkage methods for models fitted by linear, generalized linear, or Cox regression, even if these models involve fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines to estimate the influence of a continuous variable by a nonlinear function. The approaches and usage of the package shrink are illustrated by means of two examples.","The contributed R package Newdistns written by the authors is introduced. This package computes the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, quantile function, random numbers and some measures of inference for nineteen families of distributions. Each family is flexible enough to encompass a large number of structures. The use of the package is illustrated using a real data set. Also robustness of random number generation is checked by simulation.","The R package gsbDesign provides functions to evaluate the operating characteristics of Bayesian group sequential clinical trial designs. More specifically, we consider clinical trials with interim analyses, which compare a treatment with a control, and where the endpoint is normally distributed. Prior information can either be specified for the difference of treatment and control, or separately for the effects in the treatment and the control groups. At each interim analysis, the decision to stop or continue the trial is based on the posterior distribution of the difference between treatment and control. The decision at the final analysis is also based on this posterior distribution. Multiple success and/or futility criteria can be specified to reflect adequately medical decision-making. We describe methods to evaluate the operating characteristics of such designs for scenarios corresponding to different true treatment and control effects. The characteristics of main interest are the probabilities of success and futility at each interim analysis, and the expected sample size. We illustrate the use of gsbDesign with a detailed case study.","Partially observed Markov process (POMP) models, also known as hidden Markov models or state space models, are ubiquitous tools for time series analysis. The R package pomp provides a very flexible framework for Monte Carlo statistical investigations using nonlinear, non-Gaussian POMP models. A range of modern statistical methods for POMP models have been implemented in this framework including sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian computation, maximum synthetic likelihood estimation, nonlinear forecasting, and trajectory matching. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies using some simple toy problems. We also illustrate the specification of more complex POMP models, using a nonlinear epidemiological model with a discrete population, seasonality, and extra-demographic stochasticity. We discuss the specification of user-defined models and the development of additional methods within the programming environment provided by pomp.","We present the R package missMDA which performs principal component methods on incomplete data sets, aiming to obtain scores, loadings and graphical representations despite missing values. Package methods include principal component analysis for continuous variables, multiple correspondence analysis for categorical variables, factorial analysis on mixed data for both continuous and categorical variables, and multiple factor analysis for multi-table data. Furthermore, missMDA can be used to perform single imputation to complete data involving continuous, categorical and mixed variables. A multiple imputation method is also available. In the principal component analysis framework, variability across different imputations is represented by confidence areas around the row and column positions on the graphical outputs. This allows assessment of the credibility of results obtained from incomplete data sets.","Quantile-based approaches to the spectral analysis of time series have recently attracted a lot of attention. Several methods for estimation have been proposed in the literature and their statistical properties were analyzed. Yet, so far, neither a systematic method for computation nor a comprehensive software implementation are available to date. This paper contains two main contributions. First, an extensible framework for quantile-based spectral analysis of time series is developed and documented using object-oriented models. A comprehensive, open source reference implementation of this framework is provided in the R package quantspec, which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. The second contribution of the present paper is to provide a detailed tutorial, with worked examples, for this R package. A reader who is already familiar with quantile-based spectral analysis and whose primary interest is not the design of the quantspec package, but how to use it, can read the tutorial and worked examples (Sections 3 and 4) independently.","We present a new package in R implementing Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). The package introduces many new features for data analysis using BART such as variable selection, interaction detection, model diagnostic plots, incorporation of missing data and the ability to save trees for future prediction. It is significantly faster than the current R implementation, parallelized, and capable of handling both large sample sizes and high-dimensional data.","Methods for clustering in unsupervised learning are an important part of the statistical toolbox in numerous scientific disciplines. Tewari, Giering, and Raghunathan (2011) proposed to use so-called Gaussian mixture copula models (GMCM) for general unsupervised learning based on clustering. Li, Brown, Huang, and Bickel (2011) independently discussed a special case of these GMCMs as a novel approach to meta-analysis in highdimensional settings. GMCMs have attractive properties which make them highly flexible and therefore interesting alternatives to other well-established methods. However, parameter estimation is hard because of intrinsic identifiability issues and intractable likelihood functions. Both aforementioned papers discuss similar expectation-maximization-like algorithms as their pseudo maximum likelihood estimation procedure. We present and discuss an improved implementation in R of both classes of GMCMs along with various alternative optimization routines to the EM algorithm. The software is freely available in the R package GMCM. The implementation is fast, general, and optimized for very large numbers of observations. We demonstrate the use of package GMCM through different applications.","The statistical analysis of circular, multivariate circular, and spherical data is very important in different areas, such as paleomagnetism, astronomy and biology. The use of nonnegative trigonometric sums allows for the construction of flexible probability models for these types of data to model datasets with skewness and multiple modes. The R package CircNNTSR includes functions to plot, fit by maximum likelihood, and simulate models based on nonnegative trigonometric sums for circular, multivariate circular, and spherical data. For maximum likelihood estimation of the models for the three different types of data an efficient Newton-like algorithm on a hypersphere is used. Examples of applications of the functions provided in the CircNNTSR package to actual and simulated datasets are presented and it is shown how the package can be used to test for uniformity, homogeneity, and independence using likelihood ratio tests.","robustloggamma is an R package for robust estimation and inference in the generalized loggamma model. We briefly introduce the model, the estimation procedures and the computational algorithms. Then, we illustrate the use of the package with the help of a real data set.","flexsurv is an R package for fully-parametric modeling of survival data. Any parametric time-to-event distribution may be fitted if the user supplies a probability density or hazard function, and ideally also their cumulative versions. Standard survival distributions are built in, including the three and four-parameter generalized gamma and F distributions. Any parameter of any distribution can be modeled as a linear or log-linear function of covariates. The package also includes the spline model of Royston and Parmar (2002), in which both baseline survival and covariate effects can be arbitrarily flexible parametric functions of time. The main model-fitting function, flexsurvreg, uses the familiar syntax of survreg from the standard survival package (Therneau 2016). Censoring or left-truncation are specified in 'Surv' objects. The models are fitted by maximizing the full log-likelihood, and estimates and confidence intervals for any function of the model parameters can be printed or plotted. flexsurv also provides functions for fitting and predicting from fully-parametric multi-state models, and connects with the mstate package (de Wreede, Fiocco, and Putter 2011). This article explains the methods and design principles of the package, giving several worked examples of its use.","ggmcmc is an R package for analyzing Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations from Bayesian inference. By using a well known example of hierarchical/multilevel modeling, the article reviews the potential uses and options of the package, ranging from classical convergence tests to caterpillar plots or posterior predictive checks.","Public health surveillance aims at lessening disease burden by, e.g., timely recognizing emerging outbreaks in case of infectious diseases. Seen from a statistical perspective, this implies the use of appropriate methods for monitoring time series of aggregated case reports. This paper presents the tools for such automatic aberration detection offered by the R package surveillance. We introduce the functionalities for the visualization, modeling and monitoring of surveillance time series. With respect to modeling we focus on univariate time series modeling based on generalized linear models (GLMs), multivariate GLMs, generalized additive models and generalized additive models for location, shape and scale. Applications of such modeling include illustrating implementational improvements and extensions of the well-known Farrington algorithm, e.g., by spline-modeling or by treating it in a Bayesian context. Furthermore, we look at categorical time series and address overdispersion using beta-binomial or Dirichlet-multinomial modeling. With respect to monitoring we consider detectors based on either a Shewhart-like single timepoint comparison between the observed count and the predictive distribution or by likelihoodratio based cumulative sum methods. Finally, we illustrate how surveillance can support aberration detection in practice by integrating it into the monitoring workflow of a public health institution. Altogether, the present article shows how well surveillance can support automatic aberration detection in a public health surveillance context.","We describe an R package which implements grammatical evolution (GE) for automatic program generation. By performing an unconstrained optimization over a population of R expressions generated via a user-defined grammar, programs which achieve a desired goal can be discovered. The package facilitates the coding and execution of GE programs, and supports parallel execution. In addition, three applications of GE in statistics and machine learning, including hyper-parameter optimization, classification and feature generation are studied.","Modern data collection and analysis pipelines often involve a sophisticated mix of applications written in general purpose and specialized programming languages. Many formats commonly used to import and export data between different programs or systems, such as CSV or JSON, are verbose, inefficient, not type-safe, or tied to a specific programming language. Protocol Buffers are a popular method of serializing structured data between applications  -  while remaining independent of programming languages or operating systems. They offer a unique combination of features, performance, and maturity that seems particularly well suited for data-driven applications and numerical computing. The RProtoBuf package provides a complete interface to Protocol Buffers from the R environment for statistical computing. This paper outlines the general class of data serialization requirements for statistical computing, describes the implementation of the RProtoBuf package, and illustrates its use with example applications in large-scale data collection pipelines and web services.","The growth in the use of computationally intensive statistical procedures, especially with big data, has necessitated the usage of parallel computation on diverse platforms such as multicore, GPUs, clusters and clouds. However, slowdown due to interprocess communication costs typically limits such methods to \"embarrassingly parallel\" (EP) algorithms, especially on non-shared memory platforms. This paper develops a broadlyapplicable method for converting many non-EP algorithms into statistically equivalent EP ones. The method is shown to yield excellent levels of speedup for a variety of statistical computations. It also overcomes certain problems of memory limitations.","Through topological expectations regarding smooth, thresholded n-dimensional Gaussian continua, random field theory (RFT) describes probabilities associated with both the field-wide maximum and threshold-surviving upcrossing geometry. A key application of RFT is a correction for multiple comparisons which affords field-level hypothesis testing for both univariate and multivariate fields. For unbroken isotropic fields just one parameter in addition to the mean and variance is required: the ratio of a field's size to its smoothness. Ironically the simplest manifestation of RFT (1D unbroken fields) has rarely surfaced in the literature, even during its foundational development in the late 1970s. This Python package implements 1D RFT primarily for exploring and validating RFT expectations, but also describes how it can be applied to yield statistical inferences regarding sets of experimental 1D fields.","The runjags package provides a set of interface functions to facilitate running Markov chain Monte Carlo models in JAGS from within R. Automated calculation of appropriate convergence and sample length diagnostics, user-friendly access to commonly used graphical outputs and summary statistics, and parallelized methods of running JAGS are provided. Template model specifications can be generated using a standard lme4-style formula interface to assist users less familiar with the BUGS syntax. Automated simulation study functions are implemented to facilitate model performance assessment, as well as drop-k type cross-validation studies, using high performance computing clusters such as those provided by parallel. A module extension for JAGS is also included within runjags, providing the Pareto family of distributions and a series of minimally-informative priors including the DuMouchel and half-Cauchy priors. This paper outlines the primary functions of this package, and gives an illustration of a simulation study to assess the sensitivity of two equivalent model formulations to different prior distributions.","Graphlet analysis is a useful tool for describing local network topology around individual nodes or edges. A node or an edge can be described by a vector containing the counts of different kinds of graphlets (small induced subgraphs) in which it appears, or the \"roles\" (orbits) it has within these graphlets. We implemented an R package with functions for fast computation of such counts on sparse graphs. Instead of enumerating all induced graphlets, our algorithm is based on the derived relations between the counts, which decreases the time complexity by an order of magnitude in comparison with past approaches.","Markov chains are well-established probabilistic models of a wide variety of real systems that evolve along time. Countless examples of applications of Markov chains that successfully capture the probabilistic nature of real problems include areas as diverse as biology, medicine, social science, and engineering. One interesting feature which characterizes certain kinds of Markov chains is their stationary distribution, which stands for the global fraction of time the system spends in each state. The computation of the stationary distribution requires precise knowledge of the transition probabilities. When the only information available is a sequence of observations drawn from the system, such probabilities have to be estimated. Here we review an existing method to estimate fuzzy transition probabilities from observations and, with them, obtain the fuzzy stationary distribution of the resulting fuzzy Markov chain. The method also works when the user directly provides fuzzy transition probabilities. We provide an implementation in the R environment that is the first available to the community and serves as a proof of concept. We demonstrate the usefulness of our proposal with computational experiments on a toy problem, namely a time-homogeneous Markov chain that guides the randomized movement of an autonomous robot that patrols a small area.","Sample selection models deal with the situation in which an outcome of interest is observed for a restricted non-randomly selected sample of the population. The estimation of these models is based on a binary equation, which describes the selection process, and an outcome equation, which is used to examine the substantive question of interest. Classic sample selection models assume a priori that continuous covariates have a linear or pre-specified non-linear relationship to the outcome, and that the distribution linking the two equations is bivariate normal. We introduce the R package SemiParSampleSel which implements copula regression spline sample selection models. The proposed implementation can deal with non-random sample selection, non-linear covariate-response relationships, and non-normal bivariate distributions between the model equations. We provide details of the model and algorithm and describe the implementation in SemiParSampleSel. The package is illustrated using simulated and real data examples.","Outcomes of continuous proportions arise in many applied areas. Such data are typically measured as percentages, rates or proportions confined in the unitary interval. In this paper, the R package simplexreg which provides dispersion model fitting of the simplex distribution is introduced to model such proportional outcomes. The maximum likelihood method and generalized estimating equations techniques are available for parameter estimation in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, respectively. This paper presents methods and algorithms implemented in the package, including parameter estimation, model checking as well as density, cumulative distribution, quantile and random number generating functions of the simplex distribution. The package is applied to real data sets for illustration.","Gaussian process (GP) regression models make for powerful predictors in out of sample exercises, but cubic runtimes for dense matrix decompositions severely limit the size of data  -  training and testing  -  on which they can be deployed. That means that in computer experiment, spatial/geo-physical, and machine learning contexts, GPs no longer enjoy privileged status as data sets continue to balloon in size. We discuss an implementation of local approximate Gaussian process models, in the laGP package for R, that offers a particular sparse-matrix remedy uniquely positioned to leverage modern parallel computing architectures. The laGP approach can be seen as an update on the spatial statistical method of local kriging neighborhoods. We briefly review the method, and provide extensive illustrations of the features in the package through worked-code examples. The appendix covers custom building options for symmetric multi-processor and graphical processing units, and built-in wrapper routines that automate distribution over a simple network of workstations.","We present growfunctions for R that offers Bayesian nonparametric estimation models for analysis of dependent, noisy time series data indexed by a collection of domains. This data structure arises from combining periodically published government survey statistics, such as are reported in the Current Population Study (CPS). The CPS publishes monthly, by-state estimates of employment levels, where each state expresses a noisy time series. Published state-level estimates from the CPS are composed from household survey responses in a model-free manner and express high levels of volatility due to insufficient sample sizes. Existing software solutions borrow information over a modeled time-based dependence to extract a de-noised time series for each domain. These solutions, however, ignore the dependence among the domains that may be additionally leveraged to improve estimation efficiency. The growfunctions package offers two fully nonparametric mixture models that simultaneously estimate both a time and domain-indexed dependence structure for a collection of time series: (1) A Gaussian process (GP) construction, which is parameterized through the covariance matrix, estimates a latent function for each domain. The covariance parameters of the latent functions are indexed by domain under a Dirichlet process prior that permits estimation of the dependence among functions across the domains: (2) An intrinsic Gaussian Markov random field prior construction provides an alternative to the GP that expresses different computation and estimation properties. In addition to performing denoised estimation of latent functions from published domain estimates, growfunctions allows estimation of collections of functions for observation units (e.g., households), rather than aggregated domains, by accounting for an informative sampling design under which the probabilities for inclusion of observation units are related to the response variable. growfunctions includes plot functions that allow visual assessments of the fit performance and dependence structure of the estimated functions. Computational efficiency is achieved by performing the sampling for estimation functions using compiled C++.","This article presents the PST R package for categorical sequence analysis with probabilistic suffix trees (PSTs), i.e., structures that store variable-length Markov chains (VLMCs). VLMCs allow to model high-order dependencies in categorical sequences with parsimonious models based on simple estimation procedures. The package is specifically adapted to the field of social sciences, as it allows for VLMC models to be learned from sets of individual sequences possibly containing missing values; in addition, the package is extended to account for case weights. This article describes how a VLMC model is learned from one or more categorical sequences and stored in a PST. The PST can then be used for sequence prediction, i.e., to assign a probability to whole observed or artificial sequences. This feature supports data mining applications such as the extraction of typical patterns and outliers. This article also introduces original visualization tools for both the model and the outcomes of sequence prediction. Other features such as functions for pattern mining and artificial sequence generation are described as well. The PST package also allows for the computation of probabilistic divergence between two models and the fitting of segmented VLMCs, where sub-models fitted to distinct strata of the learning sample are stored in a single PST.","When modeling economic relationships it is increasingly common to encounter data sampled at different frequencies. We introduce the R package midasr which enables estimating regression models with variables sampled at different frequencies within a MIDAS regression framework put forward in work by Ghysels, Santa-Clara, and Valkanov (2002). In this article we define a general autoregressive MIDAS regression model with multiple variables of different frequencies and show how it can be specified using the familiar R formula interface and estimated using various optimization methods chosen by the researcher. We discuss how to check the validity of the estimated model both in terms of numerical convergence and statistical adequacy of a chosen regression specification, how to perform model selection based on a information criterion, how to assess forecasting accuracy of the MIDAS regression model and how to obtain a forecast aggregation of different MIDAS regression models. We illustrate the capabilities of the package with a simulated MIDAS regression model and give two empirical examples of application of MIDAS regression.","Witten and Tibshirani (2010) proposed an algorithim to simultaneously find clusters and select clustering variables, called sparse K-means (SK-means). SK-means is particularly useful when the dataset has a large fraction of noise variables (that is, variables without useful information to separate the clusters). SK-means works very well on clean and complete data but cannot handle outliers nor missing data. To remedy these problems we introduce a new robust and sparse K-means clustering algorithm implemented in the R package RSKC. We demonstrate the use of our package on four datasets. We also conduct a Monte Carlo study to compare the performances of RSK-means and SK-means regarding the selection of important variables and identification of clusters. Our simulation study shows that RSK-means performs well on clean data and better than SK-means and other competitors on outlier-contaminated data.","penalized is a flexible, extensible, and efficient MATLAB toolbox for penalized maximum likelihood. penalized allows you to fit a generalized linear model (gaussian, logistic, poisson, or multinomial) using any of ten provided penalties, or none. The toolbox can be extended by creating new maximum likelihood models or new penalties. The toolbox also includes routines for cross-validation and plotting.","Joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data constitute an attractive modeling framework that has received a lot of interest in the recent years. This paper presents the capabilities of the R package JMbayes for fitting these models under a Bayesian approach using Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. JMbayes can fit a wide range of joint models, including among others joint models for continuous and categorical longitudinal responses, and provides several options for modeling the association structure between the two outcomes. In addition, this package can be used to derive dynamic predictions for both outcomes, and offers several tools to validate these predictions in terms of discrimination and calibration. All these features are illustrated using a real data example on patients with primary biliary cirrhosis.","This article describes the extreme value analysis (EVA) R package extRemes version 2.0, which is completely redesigned from previous versions. The functions primarily provide utilities for implementing univariate EVA, with a focus on weather and climate applications, including the incorporation of covariates, as well as some functionality for assessing bivariate tail dependence.","This article introduces the R package ExtremeBounds to perform extreme bounds analysis (EBA), a sensitivity test that examines how robustly the dependent variable of a regression model is related to a variety of possible determinants. ExtremeBounds supports Leamer's EBA that focuses on the upper and lower extreme bounds of regression coefficients, as well as Sala-i-Martin's EBA which considers their entire distribution. In contrast to existing alternatives, it can estimate models of a variety of user-defined sizes, use regression models other than ordinary least squares, incorporate non-linearities in the model specification, and apply custom weights and standard errors. To alleviate concerns about the multicollinearity and conceptual overlap of examined variables, ExtremeBounds allows users to specify sets of mutually exclusive variables, and can restrict the analysis to coefficients from regression models that yield a variance inflation factor within a prespecified limit.","R2MLwiN is a new package designed to run the multilevel modeling software program MLwiN from within the R environment. It allows for a large range of models to be specified which take account of a multilevel structure, including continuous, binary, proportion, count, ordinal and nominal responses for data structures which are nested, cross-classified and/or exhibit multiple membership. Estimation is available via iterative generalized least squares (IGLS), which yields maximum likelihood estimates, and also via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation for Bayesian inference. As well as employing MLwiN's own MCMC engine, users can request that MLwiN write BUGS model, data and initial values statements for use with WinBUGS or OpenBUGS (which R2MLwiN automatically calls via rbugs), employing IGLS starting values from MLwiN. Users can also take advantage of MLwiN's graphical user interface: for example to specify models and inspect plots via its interactive equations and graphics windows. R2MLwiN is supported by a large number of examples, reproducing all the analyses conducted in MLwiN's IGLS and MCMC manuals.","This special volume celebrates the 20th anniversary of the Journal of Statistical Software (JSS) and is a Festschrift for its founding editor Jan de Leeuw. Jan recently retired from his long-held position as founding chair of the Department of Statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles. The contributions to this special volume look back at some of his research interests and accomplishments during the half-century that he has been active in psychometrics and statistics. In this introduction, the guest editors also reminisce on their own first encounters with Jan, ten years ago. Since that time JSS has solidified its place as a leading journal of computational statistics, a fact that has a lot to do with Jan's stewardship. We include a brief history of JSS.","The Journal of Statistical Software was founded by Jan de Leeuw in 1996, the year before the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) first made R and contributed R packages widely available on the Internet. Within a few years, R came increasingly to dominate contributions to JSS. We trace the continuing development of R and CRAN, and the representation of R and other statistical software in the pages of JSS.","This paper is a mixture of my personal experiences of Jan de Leeuw as a supervisor of my master's and Ph.D. theses, as well as a sketch of how three-way analysis, the subject Jan chose for me, developed over time. The emphasis is on where it is and was applied, and to what extent it stole the hearts of applied researchers in different disciplines. Furthermore, the paper contains some musings about how we should go about promoting the use of the techniques, especially in the social and behavioural sciences. Finally, an overview is provided of available software and attention is paid to how (three-way) software may be designed to encourage its use by the scientific community, as it befits a paper in the Journal of Statistical Software.","Gifi was the nom de plume for a group of researchers led by Jan de Leeuw at the University of Leiden. Between 1970 and 1990 the group produced a stream of theoretical papers and computer programs in the area of nonlinear multivariate analysis that were very innovative. In an informal way this paper discusses the so-called Gifi system of nonlinear multivariate analysis, that entails homogeneity analysis (which is closely related to multiple correspondence analysis) and generalizations. The history is discussed, giving attention to the scientific philosophy of this group, and links to machine learning are indicated.","Starting with the common origins of biometrics and psychometrics at the beginning of the twentieth century, the paper compares and contrasts subsequent developments, informed by the author's 35 years at Rothamsted Experimental Station followed by a period with the data theory group in Leiden and thereafter. Although the methods used by biometricians and psychometricians have much in common, there are important differences arising from the different fields of study. Similar differences arise wherever data are generated and may be regarded as a major driving force in the development of statistical ideas.","The Dutch and the French schools of data analysis differ in their approaches to the question: How does one understand and summarize the information contained in a data set? The commonalities and discrepancies between the schools are explored here with a focus on methods dedicated to the analysis of categorical data, which are known either as homogeneity analysis (HOMALS) or multiple correspondence analysis (MCA).","It has been over 40 years since I got to know Jan. This period almost entirely overlaps my career as a psychometrician. During these years, I have had many contacts with him. This paper reviews some of my early interactions, focussing on the following topics: (1) An episode surrounding the inception of the ALSOS project, and (2) Jan's unpublished (and some lost) notes and papers that I cherished and quoted in my work, including (2a) the ELEGANT algorithm for squared distance scaling, (2b) the INDISCAL method for nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS), and (2c) notes on DEDICOM.","A major breakthrough in the visualization of dissimilarities between pairs of objects was the formulation of the least-squares multidimensional scaling (MDS) model as defined by the Stress function. This function is quite flexible in that it allows possibly nonlinear transformations of the dissimilarities to be represented by distances between points in a low dimensional space. To obtain the visualization, the Stress function should be minimized over the coordinates of the points and the over the transformation. In a series of papers, Jan de Leeuw has made a significant contribution to majorization methods for the minimization of Stress in least-squares MDS. In this paper, we present a review of the majorization algorithm for MDS as implemented in the smacof package and related approaches. We present several illustrative examples and special cases.","Jan de Leeuw came to University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Statistics at a crucial time in its history. We set out some details of what he found when he arrived on UCLA's north campus in 1987, what was there when he left it some 27 years later, and how he fashioned the changes that are now so widely recognized.","Generalized additive models for location, scale and shape are a flexible class of regression models that allow to model multiple parameters of a distribution function, such as the mean and the standard deviation, simultaneously. With the R package gamboostLSS, we provide a boosting method to fit these models. Variable selection and model choice are naturally available within this regularized regression framework. To introduce and illustrate the R package gamboostLSS and its infrastructure, we use a data set on stunted growth in India. In addition to the specification and application of the model itself, we present a variety of convenience functions, including methods for tuning parameter selection, prediction and visualization of results. The package gamboostLSS is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gamboostLSS.","This paper introduces the R package CDM for cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs). The package implements parameter estimation procedures for two general CDM frameworks, the generalized-deterministic input noisy-and-gate (G-DINA) and the general diagnostic model (GDM). It contains additional functions for analyzing data under these frameworks, like tools for simulating and plotting data, or for evaluating global model and item fit. The paper describes the theoretical aspects of implemented CDM frameworks and it illustrates the usage of the package with empirical data of the common fraction subtraction test by Tatsuoka (1984).","The R package vdg provides a flexible interface for producing various graphical summaries of the prediction variance associated with specific linear model specifications and experimental designs. These methods include variance dispersion graphs, fraction of design space plots and quantile plots which can assist in choosing between a catalogue of candidate experimental designs. Instead of restrictive optimization methods used in traditional software to explore design regions, vdg utilizes sampling methods to introduce more flexibility. The package takes advantage of R's modern graphical abilities via ggplot2 (Wickham 2009), adds facilities for using a variety of distance methods, allows for more flexible model specifications and incorporates quantile regressions to help with model comparison.","Clickstream analysis is a useful tool for investigating consumer behavior, market research and software testing. I present the clickstream package which provides functionality for reading, clustering, analyzing and writing clickstreams in R. The package allows for a modeling of lists of clickstreams as zero-, first- and higher-order Markov chains. I illustrate the application of clickstream for a list of representative clickstreams from an online store.","Checking the validity of test scores is important in both educational and psychological measurement. Person-fit analysis provides several statistics that help practitioners assessing whether individual item score vectors conform to a prespecified item response theory model or, alternatively, to a group of test takers. Software enabling easy access to most person-fit statistics was lacking up to now. The PerFit R package was written in order to fill in this void. A theoretical overview of relatively simple person-fit statistics is provided. A practical guide showing how the main functions of PerFit can be used is also given. Both numerical and graphical tools are described and illustrated using examples. The goal is to show how person-fit statistics can be easily applied to testing of questionnaire data.","Jacquez's Q is a set of statistics for detecting the presence and location of space-time clusters of disease exposure. Until now, the only implementation was available in the proprietary SpaceStat software which is not suitable for a pipeline Linux environment. We have developed an open source implementation of Jacquez's Q statistics in Python using an object-oriented approach. The most recent source code for the implementation is available at https://github.com/sjirjies/pyJacqQ under the GPL-3. It has a command line interface and a Python application programming interface.","The package VIM (Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) is developed to explore and analyze the structure of missing values in data using visualization methods, to impute these missing values with the built-in imputation methods and to verify the imputation process using visualization tools, as well as to produce high-quality graphics for publications. This article focuses on the different imputation techniques available in the package. Four different imputation methods are currently implemented in VIM, namely hot-deck imputation, k-nearest neighbor imputation, regression imputation and iterative robust model-based imputation (Templ, Kowarik, and Filzmoser 2011). All of these methods are implemented in a flexible manner with many options for customization. Furthermore in this article practical examples are provided to highlight the use of the implemented methods on real-world applications. In addition, the graphical user interface of VIM has been re-implemented from scratch resulting in the package VIMGUI (Schopfhauser, Templ, Alfons, Kowarik, and Prantner 2016) to enable users without extensive R skills to access these imputation and visualization methods.","The R package equate contains functions for observed-score linking and equating under single-group, equivalent-groups, and nonequivalent-groups with anchor test(s) designs. This paper introduces these designs and provides an overview of observed-score equating with details about each of the supported methods. Examples demonstrate the basic functionality of the equate package.","The R package ClickClust is a new piece of software devoted to finite mixture modeling and model-based clustering of categorical sequences. As a special kind of time series, categorical sequences, also known as categorical time series, exhibit a time-dependent nature and are traditionally modeled by means of Markov chains. Clustering categorical sequences is an important problem with multiple applications, but grouping sequences of sites or web-pages, also known as clickstreams, is one of the most well-known problems that helps discover common navigation patterns and routes taken by users. This popular application is recognized in the package title ClickClust. The paper discusses methodological and algorithmic foundations of the package based on finite mixtures of Markov models. The number of Markov chain states can often be large leading to high-dimensional transition probability matrices. The high number of model parameters can affect clustering performance severely. As a remedy to this problem, backward and forward selection algorithms are proposed for grouping states. This extends the original clustering problem to a biclustering framework. Among other capabilities of ClickClust, there are the estimation of the variance-covariance matrix corresponding to model parameter estimates, prediction of future states visited, and the construction of a display named click-plot that helps illustrate the obtained clustering solutions. All available functions and the utility of the package are thoroughly discussed and illustrated on multiple examples.","Rchoice is a package in R for estimating models with individual heterogeneity for both cross-sectional and panel (longitudinal) data. In particular, the package allows binary, ordinal and count response, as well as continuous and discrete covariates. Individual heterogeneity is modeled by allowing the parameter associated with each observed variable (e.g., its coefficient) to vary randomly across individuals according to some pre-specified distribution. Simulated maximum likelihood method is implemented for the estimation of the moments of the distributions. In addition, functions for plotting the conditional individual-specific coefficients and their confidence interval are provided. This article is a general description of Rchoice and all functionalities are illustrated using real databases.","In many contexts, confidentiality constraints severely restrict access to unique and valuable microdata. Synthetic data which mimic the original observed data and preserve the relationships between variables but do not contain any disclosive records are one possible solution to this problem. The synthpop package for R, introduced in this paper, provides routines to generate synthetic versions of original data sets. We describe the methodology and its consequences for the data characteristics. We illustrate the package features using a survey data example.","Simulations are a practical and reliable approach to power calculations, especially for multi-level mixed effects models where the analytic solutions can be very complex. In addition, power calculations are model-specific and multi-level mixed effects models are defined by a plethora of parameters. In other words, model variations in this context are numerous and so are the tailored algebraic calculations. This article describes ipdpower in Stata, a new simulations-based command that calculates power for mixed effects two-level data structures. Although the command was developed having individual patient data meta-analyses and primary care databases analyses in mind, where patients are nested within studies and general practices respectively, the methods apply to any two-level structure.","In many applications researchers are typically interested in testing for inequality constraints in the context of linear fixed effects and mixed effects models. Although there exists a large body of literature for performing statistical inference under inequality constraints, user friendly statistical software implementing such methods is lacking, especially in the context of linear fixed and mixed effects models. In this article we introduce CLME, a package in the R language that can be used for testing a broad collection of inequality constraints. It uses residual bootstrap based methodology which is reasonably robust to non-normality as well as heteroscedasticity. The package is illustrated using two data sets. The package also contains a graphical user interface built using the shiny package.","This monograph details the implementation and use of the CollocInfer package in R for smoothing-based estimation of continuous-time nonlinear dynamic systems. These routines represent an extension of the generalized profiling methods in Ramsay, Hooker, Campbell, and Cao (2007) for estimating parameters in nonlinear ordinary differential equations. An interface to the fda package is included. The package also supports discretetime systems. We describe the methodological and computational framework and the necessary steps to use the software. Equivalent functionality is available in MATLAB.","We present the R package mnlogit for estimating multinomial logistic regression models, particularly those involving a large number of categories and variables. Compared to existing software, mnlogit offers speedups of 10 - 50 times for modestly sized problems and more than 100 times for larger problems. Running in parallel mode on a multicore machine gives up to 4 times additional speedup on 8 processor cores. mnlogit achieves its computational efficiency by drastically speeding up computation of the log-likelihood function's Hessian matrix through exploiting structure in matrices that arise in intermediate calculations. This efficient exploitation of intermediate data structures allows mnlogit to utilize system memory much more efficiently, such that for most applications mnlogit requires less memory than comparable software by a factor that is proportional to the number of model categories.","Global optimization is an important field of research both in mathematics and computer sciences. It has applications in nearly all fields of modern science and engineering. Memetic algorithms are powerful problem solvers in the domain of continuous optimization, as they offer a trade-off between exploration of the search space using an evolutionary algorithm scheme, and focused exploitation of promising regions with a local search algorithm. In particular, we describe the memetic algorithms with local search chains (MA-LS-Chains) paradigm, and the R package Rmalschains, which implements them. MA-LS-Chains has proven to be effective compared to other algorithms, especially in high-dimensional problem solving. In an experimental study, we demonstrate the advantages of using Rmalschains for high-dimension optimization problems in comparison to other optimization methods already available in R.","We describe bayesPop, an R package for producing probabilistic population projections for all countries. This uses probabilistic projections of total fertility and life expectancy generated by Bayesian hierarchical models. It produces a sample from the joint posterior predictive distribution of future age- and sex-specific population counts, fertility rates and mortality rates, as well as future numbers of births and deaths. It provides graphical ways of summarizing this information, including trajectory plots and various kinds of probabilistic population pyramids. An expression language is introduced which allows the user to produce the predictive distribution of a wide variety of derived population quantities, such as the median age or the old age dependency ratio. The package produces aggregated projections for sets of countries, such as UN regions or trading blocs. The methodology has been used by the United Nations to produce their most recent official population projections for all countries, published in the World Population Prospects.","As any real-life data, data modeled by linear mixed-effects models often contain outliers or other contamination. Even little contamination can drive the classic estimates far away from what they would be without the contamination. At the same time, datasets that require mixed-effects modeling are often complex and large. This makes it difficult to spot contamination. Robust estimation methods aim to solve both problems: to provide estimates where contamination has only little influence and to detect and flag contamination. We introduce an R package, robustlmm, to robustly fit linear mixed-effects models. The package's functions and methods are designed to closely equal those offered by lme4, the R package that implements classic linear mixed-effects model estimation in R. The robust estimation method in robustlmm is based on the random effects contamination model and the central contamination model. Contamination can be detected at all levels of the data. The estimation method does not make any assumption on the data's grouping structure except that the model parameters are estimable. robustlmm supports hierarchical and non-hierarchical (e.g., crossed) grouping structures. The robustness of the estimates and their asymptotic efficiency is fully controlled through the function interface. Individual parts (e.g., fixed effects and variance components) can be tuned independently. In this tutorial, we show how to fit robust linear mixed-effects models using robustlmm, how to assess the model fit, how to detect outliers, and how to compare different fits.","The BUGS language offers a very flexible way of specifying complex statistical models for the purposes of Gibbs sampling, while its JAGS variant offers very convenient R integration via the rjags package. However, including smoothers in JAGS models can involve some quite tedious coding, especially for multivariate or adaptive smoothers. Further, if an additive smooth structure is required then some care is needed, in order to centre smooths appropriately, and to find appropriate starting values. R package mgcv implements a wide range of smoothers, all in a manner appropriate for inclusion in JAGS code, and automates centring and other smooth setup tasks. The purpose of this note is to describe an interface between mgcv and JAGS, based around an R function, jagam, which takes a generalized additive model (GAM) as specified in mgcv and automatically generates the JAGS model code and data required for inference about the model via Gibbs sampling. Although the auto-generated JAGS code can be run as is, the expectation is that the user would wish to modify it in order to add complex stochastic model components readily specified in JAGS. A simple interface is also provided for visualisation and further inference about the estimated smooth components using standard mgcv functionality. The methods described here will be un-necessarily inefficient if all that is required is fully Bayesian inference about a standard GAM, rather than the full flexibility of JAGS. In that case the BayesX package would be more efficient.","Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.","Blind source separation (BSS) is a well-known signal processing tool which is used to solve practical data analysis problems in various fields of science. In BSS, we assume that the observed data consists of linear mixtures of latent variables. The mixing system and the distributions of the latent variables are unknown. The aim is to find an estimate of an unmixing matrix which then transforms the observed data back to latent sources. In this paper we present the R packages JADE and BSSasymp. The package JADE offers several BSS methods which are based on joint diagonalization. Package BSSasymp contains functions for computing the asymptotic covariance matrices as well as their data-based estimates for most of the BSS estimators included in package JADE. Several simulated and real datasets are used to illustrate the functions in these two packages.","etasFLP is an R package which fits an epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model to an earthquake catalog; non-parametric background seismicity can be estimated through a forward predictive likelihood approach, while parametric components of triggered seismicity are estimated through maximum likelihood; estimation steps are alternated until convergence is obtained and for each event the probability of being a background event is estimated. The package includes options which allow its wide use. Methods for plot, summary and profile are defined for the main output class object. The paper provides examples of the package's use with description of the underlying R and Fortran routines.","We introduce the R package npmv that performs nonparametric inference for the comparison of multivariate data samples and provides the results in easy-to-understand, but statistically correct, language. Unlike in classical multivariate analysis of variance, multivariate normality is not required for the data. In fact, the different response variables may even be measured on different scales (binary, ordinal, quantitative). p values are calculated for overall tests (permutation tests and F approximations), and, using multiple testing algorithms which control the familywise error rate, significant subsets of response variables and factor levels are identified. The package may be used for low- or highdimensional data with small or with large sample sizes and many or few factor levels.","This paper presents DFIT, an R package that implements the differential functioning of items and tests framework as well as the Monte Carlo item parameter replication approach for producing cut-off points for differential item functioning indices. Furthermore, it illustrates how to use the package to calculate power for the NCDIF index, both post hoc, as has regularly been the case in differential item functioning empirical and simulation studies, as well as a priori given certain item parameters. The version reviewed here implements all DFIT indices and Raju's area measures for tests comprised of items modeled with the same parametric item response unidimensional model (1-, 2-, and 3-parameters, generalized partial credit model or graded response model), the Mantel-Haenszel statistic with an underlying dichotomous item response model, and the item parameter replication method for any of the estimated indices with dichotomous item response models.","Panel Data Toolbox is a new package for MATLAB that includes functions to estimate the main econometric methods of balanced and unbalanced panel data analysis. The package includes code for the standard fixed, between and random effects estimation methods, as well as for the existing instrumental panels and a wide array of spatial panels. A full set of relevant tests is also included. This paper describes the methodology and implementation of the functions and illustrates their use with well-known examples. We perform numerical checks against other popular commercial and free software to show the validity of the results.","After its introduction by Koenker and Basset (1978), quantile regression has become an important and popular tool to investigate the conditional response distribution in regression. The R package bayesQR contains a number of routines to estimate quantile regression parameters using a Bayesian approach based on the asymmetric Laplace distribution. The package contains functions for the typical quantile regression with continuous dependent variable, but also supports quantile regression for binary dependent variables. For both types of dependent variables, an approach to variable selection using the adaptive lasso approach is provided. For the binary quantile regression model, the package also contains a routine that calculates the fitted probabilities for each vector of predictors. In addition, functions for summarizing the results, creating traceplots, posterior histograms and drawing quantile plots are included. This paper starts with a brief overview of the theoretical background of the models used in the bayesQR package. The main part of this paper discusses the computational problems that arise in the implementation of the procedure and illustrates the usefulness of the package through selected examples.","The cross-entropy (CE) method is a simple and versatile technique for optimization, based on Kullback-Leibler (or cross-entropy) minimization. The method can be applied to a wide range of optimization tasks, including continuous, discrete, mixed and constrained optimization problems. The new package CEoptim provides the R implementation of the CE method for optimization. We describe the general CE methodology for optimization and well as some useful modifications. The usage and efficacy of CEoptim is demonstrated through a variety of optimization examples, including model fitting, combinatorial optimization, and maximum likelihood estimation.","Simultaneous clustering of rows and columns, usually designated by bi-clustering, coclustering or block clustering, is an important technique in two way data analysis. A new standard and efficient approach has been recently proposed based on the latent block model (Govaert and Nadif 2003) which takes into account the block clustering problem on both the individual and variable sets. This article presents our R package blockcluster for co-clustering of binary, contingency and continuous data based on these very models. In this document, we will give a brief review of the model-based block clustering methods, and we will show how the R package blockcluster can be used for co-clustering.","Hierarchical cluster analysis is a valuable tool for exploring data by describing their structure using a dendrogram. However, proper visualization and interactive inspection of the dendrogram are needed to unlock the information in the data. We describe a new R package, idendro, that enables the user to inspect dendrograms interactively: to select and color clusters, to zoom and pan the dendrogram, and to visualize the clustered data not only in a built-in heat map, but also in any interactive plot implemented in the cranvas package. A lightweight version idendr0 with reduced dependencies is also available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.","Mediation analysis is routinely adopted by researchers from a wide range of applied disciplines as a statistical tool to disentangle the causal pathways by which an exposure or treatment affects an outcome. The counterfactual framework provides a language for clearly defining path-specific effects of interest and has fostered a principled extension of mediation analysis beyond the context of linear models. This paper describes medflex, an R package that implements some recent developments in mediation analysis embedded within the counterfactual framework. The medflex package offers a set of ready-made functions for fitting natural effect models, a novel class of causal models which directly parameterize the path-specific effects of interest, thereby adding flexibility to existing software packages for mediation analysis, in particular with respect to hypothesis testing and parsimony. In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of the functionalities of the medflex package.","Do-calculus is concerned with estimating the interventional distribution of an action from the observed joint probability distribution of the variables in a given causal structure. All identifiable causal effects can be derived using the rules of do-calculus, but the rules themselves do not give any direct indication whether the effect in question is identifiable or not. Shpitser and Pearl (2006b) constructed an algorithm for identifying joint interventional distributions in causal models, which contain unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs. This algorithm can be seen as a repeated application of the rules of do-calculus and known properties of probabilities, and it ultimately either derives an expression for the causal distribution, or fails to identify the effect, in which case the effect is non-identifiable. In this paper, the R package causaleffect is presented, which provides an implementation of this algorithm. Functionality of causaleffect is also demonstrated through examples.","The R package gdistance provides classes and functions to calculate various distance measures and routes in heterogeneous geographic spaces represented as grids. Least-cost distances as well as more complex distances based on (constrained) random walks can be calculated. Also the corresponding routes or probabilities of passing each cell can be determined. The package implements classes to store the data about the probability or cost of transitioning from one cell to another on a grid in a memory-efficient sparse format. These classes make it possible to manipulate the values of cell-to-cell movement directly, which offers flexibility and the possibility to use asymmetric values. The novel distances implemented in the package are used in geographical genetics (applying circuit theory), but also have applications in other fields of geospatial analysis.","In recent years, data streams have become an increasingly important area of research for the computer science, database and statistics communities. Data streams are ordered and potentially unbounded sequences of data points created by a typically non-stationary data generating process. Common data mining tasks associated with data streams include clustering, classification and frequent pattern mining. New algorithms for these types of data are proposed regularly and it is important to evaluate them thoroughly under standardized conditions. In this paper we introduce stream, a research tool that includes modeling and simulating data streams as well as an extensible framework for implementing, interfacing and experimenting with algorithms for various data stream mining tasks. The main advantage of stream is that it seamlessly integrates with the large existing infrastructure provided by R. In addition to data handling, plotting and easy scripting capabilities, R also provides many existing algorithms and enables users to interface code written in many programming languages popular among data mining researchers (e.g., C/C++, Java and Python). In this paper we describe the architecture of stream and focus on its use for data stream clustering research. stream was implemented with extensibility in mind and will be extended in the future to cover additional data stream mining tasks like classification and frequent pattern mining.","We introduce the C++ application and R package ranger. The software is a fast implementation of random forests for high dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression and survival trees are supported. We describe the implementation, provide examples, validate the package with a reference implementation, and compare runtime and memory usage with other implementations. The new software proves to scale best with the number of features, samples, trees, and features tried for splitting. Finally, we show that ranger is the fastest and most memory efficient implementation of random forests to analyze data on the scale of a genome-wide association study.","It is well known in the literature that the problem of learning the structure of Bayesian networks is very hard to tackle: Its computational complexity is super-exponential in the number of nodes in the worst case and polynomial in most real-world scenarios. Efficient implementations of score-based structure learning benefit from past and current research in optimization theory, which can be adapted to the task by using the network score as the objective function to maximize. This is not true for approaches based on conditional independence tests, called constraint-based learning algorithms. The only optimization in widespread use, backtracking, leverages the symmetries implied by the definitions of neighborhood and Markov blanket. In this paper we illustrate how backtracking is implemented in recent versions of the bnlearn R package, and how it degrades the stability of Bayesian network structure learning for little gain in terms of speed. As an alternative, we describe a software architecture and framework that can be used to parallelize constraint-based structure learning algorithms (also implemented in bnlearn) and we demonstrate its performance using four reference networks and two real-world data sets from genetics and systems biology. We show that on modern multi-core or multiprocessor hardware parallel implementations are preferable over backtracking, which was developed when single-processor machines were the norm.","We describe a parallel implementation in R of the weighted subspace random forest algorithm (Xu, Huang, Williams, Wang, and Ye 2012) available as the wsrf package. A novel variable weighting method is used for variable subspace selection in place of the traditional approach of random variable sampling. This new approach is particularly useful in building models for high dimensional data  -  often consisting of thousands of variables. Parallel computation is used to take advantage of multi-core machines and clusters of machines to build random forest models from high dimensional data in considerably shorter times. A series of experiments presented in this paper demonstrates that wsrf is faster than existing packages whilst retaining and often improving on the classification performance, particularly for high dimensional data.","Survival methods are used for the statistical modelling of time-to-event data. Survival data are characterized by a set of complete records, in which the time of the event is known; and a set of censored records, in which the event was known to have occurred in an interval. When survival data are spatially referenced, the spatial variation in survival times may be of scientific interest. In this article, we introduce a new R package, spatsurv, for inference with spatially referenced survival data. The specific type of model fitted by this package is a parametric proportional hazards model in which the spatially correlated frailties are modelled by a log-Gaussian stochastic process. The package is extensible in that it allows the user to easily create new models for the baseline hazard function and spatial covariance function. The package implements an advanced adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to deliver Bayesian inference with minimal input from the user. A particular feature of the new package is the ability to handle large datasets via the use of auxiliary frailties on a regular grid and the technique of circulant embedding for fast matrix computations. We demonstrate the new package on a real-life dataset.","We introduce ctsem, an R package for continuous time structural equation modeling of panel (N > 1) and time series (N = 1) data, using full information maximum likelihood. Most dynamic models (e.g., cross-lagged panel models) in the social and behavioural sciences are discrete time models. An assumption of discrete time models is that time intervals between measurements are equal, and that all subjects were assessed at the same intervals. Violations of this assumption are often ignored due to the difficulty of accounting for varying time intervals, therefore parameter estimates can be biased and the time course of effects becomes ambiguous. By using stochastic differential equations to estimate an underlying continuous process, continuous time models allow for any pattern of measurement occasions. By interfacing to OpenMx, ctsem combines the flexible specification of structural equation models with the enhanced data gathering opportunities and improved estimation of continuous time models. ctsem can estimate relationships over time for multiple latent processes, measured by multiple noisy indicators with varying time intervals between observations. Within and between effects are estimated simultaneously by modeling both observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. Exogenous shocks with different shapes, group differences, higher order diffusion effects and oscillating processes can all be simply modeled. We first introduce and define continuous time models, then show how to specify and estimate a range of continuous time models using ctsem.","The development of powerful new 3D scanning techniques has enabled the generation of large up-to-date anthropometric databases which provide highly valued data to improve the ergonomic design of products adapted to the user population. As a consequence, Ergonomics and Anthropometry are two increasingly quantitative fields, so advanced statistical methodologies and modern software tools are required to get the maximum benefit from anthropometric data. This paper presents a new R package, called Anthropometry, which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It brings together some statistical methodologies concerning clustering, statistical shape analysis, statistical archetypal analysis and the statistical concept of data depth, which have been especially developed to deal with anthropometric data. They are proposed with the aim of providing effective solutions to some common anthropometric problems, such as clothing design or workstation design (focusing on the particular case of aircraft cockpits). The utility of the package is shown by analyzing the anthropometric data obtained from a survey of the Spanish female population performed in 2006 and from the 1967 United States Air Force survey. This manuscript is also contained in Anthropometry as a vignette.","This article describes the R package gcmr for fitting Gaussian copula marginal regression models. The Gaussian copula provides a mathematically convenient framework to handle various forms of dependence in regression models arising, for example, in time series, longitudinal studies or spatial data. The package gcmr implements maximum likelihood inference for Gaussian copula marginal regression. The likelihood function is approximated with a sequential importance sampling algorithm in the discrete case. The package is designed to allow a flexible specification of the regression model and the dependence structure. Illustrations include negative binomial modeling of longitudinal count data, beta regression for time series of rates and logistic regression for spatially correlated binomial data.","We describe the R package NonpModelCheck for hypothesis testing and variable selection in nonparametric regression. This package implements functions to perform hypothesis testing for the significance of a predictor or a group of predictors in a fully nonparametric heteroscedastic regression model using high-dimensional one-way ANOVA. Based on the p values from the test of each covariate, three different algorithms allow the user to perform variable selection using false discovery rate corrections. A function for classical local polynomial regression is implemented for the multivariate context, where the degree of the polynomial can be as large as needed and bandwidth selection strategies are built in.","In multivariate nonparametric analysis curse of dimensionality forces one to use large smoothing parameters. This leads to a biased smoother. Instead of focusing on optimally selecting the smoothing parameter, we fix it to some reasonably large value to ensure an over-smoothing of the data. The resulting base smoother has a small variance but a substantial bias. In this paper, we propose an R package named ibr to iteratively correct the initial bias of the (base) estimator by an estimate of the bias obtained by smoothing the residuals. After a brief description of iterated bias reduction smoothers, we examine the base smoothers implemented in the package: Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothers, Duchon splines smoothers and their low rank counterparts. Then, we explain the stopping rules available in the package and their implementation. Finally we illustrate the package on two examples: a toy example in R2 and the original Los Angeles ozone dataset.","The availability of geocoded health data and the inherent temporal structure of communicable diseases have led to an increased interest in statistical models and software for spatio-temporal data with epidemic features. The open source R package surveillance can handle various levels of aggregation at which infective events have been recorded: individual-level time-stamped geo-referenced data (case reports) in either continuous space or discrete space, as well as counts aggregated by period and region. For each of these data types, the surveillance package implements tools for visualization, likelihoood inference and simulation from recently developed statistical regression frameworks capturing endemic and epidemic dynamics. Altogether, this paper is a guide to the spatio-temporal modeling of epidemic phenomena, exemplified by analyses of public health surveillance data on measles and invasive meningococcal disease.","Health-related quality of life has become increasingly important in clinical trials over the past two decades. The R package QoLR is a recently developed package for the longitudinal analysis of health-related quality of life in oncology. This package contains the scoring of most of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaires and some programs to analyze the time to a health-related quality of life score deterioration as a modality of longitudinal analysis in oncology.","Bringing together the information latent in distributed medical databases promises to personalize medical care by enabling reliable, stable modeling of outcomes with rich feature sets (including patient characteristics and treatments received). However, there are barriers to aggregation of medical data, due to lack of standardization of ontologies, privacy concerns, proprietary attitudes toward data, and a reluctance to give up control over end use. Aggregation of data is not always necessary for model fitting. In models based on maximizing a likelihood, the computations can be distributed, with aggregation limited to the intermediate results of calculations on local data, rather than raw data. Distributed fitting is also possible for singular value decomposition. There has been work on the technical aspects of shared computation for particular applications, but little has been published on the software needed to support the \"social networking\" aspect of shared computing, to reduce the barriers to collaboration. We describe a set of software tools that allow the rapid assembly of a collaborative computational project, based on the flexible and extensible R statistical software and other open source packages, that can work across a heterogeneous collection of database environments, with full transparency to allow local officials concerned with privacy protections to validate the safety of the method. We describe the principles, architecture, and successful test results for the site-stratified Cox model and rank-k singular value decomposition.","The R package lcmm provides a series of functions to estimate statistical models based on linear mixed model theory. It includes the estimation of mixed models and latent class mixed models for Gaussian longitudinal outcomes (hlme), curvilinear and ordinal univariate longitudinal outcomes (lcmm) and curvilinear multivariate outcomes (multlcmm), as well as joint latent class mixed models (Jointlcmm) for a (Gaussian or curvilinear) longitudinal outcome and a time-to-event outcome that can be possibly left-truncated right-censored and defined in a competing setting. Maximum likelihood esimators are obtained using a modified Marquardt algorithm with strict convergence criteria based on the parameters and likelihood stability, and on the negativity of the second derivatives. The package also provides various post-fit functions including goodness-of-fit analyses, classification, plots, predicted trajectories, individual dynamic prediction of the event and predictive accuracy assessment. This paper constitutes a companion paper to the package by introducing each family of models, the estimation technique, some implementation details and giving examples through a dataset on cognitive aging.","Particle methods such as the particle filter and particle smoothers have proven very useful for solving challenging nonlinear estimation problems in a wide variety of fields during the last decade. However, there are still very few existing tools available to support and assist researchers and engineers in applying the vast number of methods in this field to their own problems. This paper identifies the common operations between the methods and describes a software framework utilizing this information to provide a flexible and extensible foundation which can be used to solve a large variety of problems in this domain, thereby allowing code reuse to reduce the implementation burden and lowering the barrier of entry for applying this exciting field of methods. The software implementation presented in this paper is freely available and permissively licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, and runs on a large number of hardware and software platforms, making it usable for a large variety of scenarios.","Rgbp is an R package that provides estimates and verifiable confidence intervals for random effects in two-level conjugate hierarchical models for overdispersed Gaussian, Poisson, and binomial data. Rgbp models aggregate data from k independent groups summarized by observed sufficient statistics for each random effect, such as sample means, possibly with covariates. Rgbp uses approximate Bayesian machinery with unique improper priors for the hyper-parameters, which leads to good repeated sampling coverage properties for random effects. A special feature of Rgbp is an option that generates synthetic data sets to check whether the interval estimates for random effects actually meet the nominal confidence levels. Additionally, Rgbp provides inference statistics for the hyper-parameters, e.g., regression coefficients.","We illustrate the R package cquad for conditional maximum likelihood estimation of the quadratic exponential (QE) model proposed by Bartolucci and Nigro (2010) for the analysis of binary panel data. The package also allows us to estimate certain modified versions of the QE model, which are based on alternative parametrizations, and it includes a function for the pseudo-conditional likelihood estimation of the dynamic logit model, as proposed by Bartolucci and Nigro (2012). We also illustrate a reduced version of this package that is available in Stata. The use of the main functions of this package is based on examples using labor market data.","In this paper we introduce a new R package, PrevMap, for the analysis of spatially referenced prevalence data, including both classical maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches to parameter estimation and plug-in or Bayesian prediction. More specifically, the new package implements fitting of geostatistical models for binomial data, based on two distinct approaches. The first approach uses a generalized linear mixed model with logistic link function, binomial error distribution and a Gaussian spatial process as a stochastic component in the linear predictor. A simpler, but approximate, alternative approach consists of fitting a linear Gaussian model to empirical-logit-transformed data. The package also includes implementations of convolution-based low-rank approximations to the Gaussian spatial process to enable computationally efficient analysis of large spatial datasets. We illustrate the use of the package through the analysis of Loa loa prevalence data from Cameroon and Nigeria. We illustrate the use of the low rank approximation using a simulated geostatistical dataset.","State space modeling is an efficient and flexible method for statistical inference of a broad class of time series and other data. This paper describes the R package KFAS for state space modeling with the observations from an exponential family, namely Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, negative binomial and gamma distributions. After introducing the basic theory behind Gaussian and non-Gaussian state space models, an illustrative example of Poisson time series forecasting is provided. Finally, a comparison to alternative R packages suitable for non-Gaussian time series modeling is presented.","somoclu is a massively parallel tool for training self-organizing maps on large data sets written in C++. It builds on OpenMP for multicore execution, and on MPI for distributing the workload across the nodes in a cluster. It is also able to boost training by using CUDA if graphics processing units are available. A sparse kernel is included, which is useful for high-dimensional but sparse data, such as the vector spaces common in text mining workflows. Python, R and MATLAB interfaces facilitate interactive use. Apart from fast execution, memory use is highly optimized, enabling training large emergent maps even on a single computer.","Although various forms of linkage map construction software are widely available, there is a distinct lack of packages for use in the R statistical computing environment (R Core Team 2017). This article introduces the ASMap linkage map construction R package which contains functions that use the efficient MSTmap algorithm (Wu, Bhat, Close, and Lonardi 2008) for clustering and optimally ordering large sets of markers. Additional to the construction functions, the package also contains a suite of tools to assist in the rapid diagnosis and repair of a constructed linkage map. The package functions can also be used for post linkage map construction techniques such as fine mapping or combining maps of the same population. To showcase the efficiency and functionality of ASMap, the complete linkage map construction process is demonstrated with a high density barley backcross marker data set.","This paper presents the R package MitISEM (mixture of t by importance sampling weighted expectation maximization) which provides an automatic and flexible two-stage method to approximate a non-elliptical target density kernel  -  typically a posterior density kernel  -  using an adaptive mixture of Student t densities as approximating density. In the first stage a mixture of Student t densities is fitted to the target using an expectation maximization algorithm where each step of the optimization procedure is weighted using importance sampling. In the second stage this mixture density is a candidate density for efficient and robust application of importance sampling or the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) method to estimate properties of the target distribution. The package enables Bayesian inference and prediction on model parameters and probabilities, in particular, for models where densities have multi-modal or other non-elliptical shapes like curved ridges. These shapes occur in research topics in several scientific fields. For instance, analysis of DNA data in bio-informatics, obtaining loans in the banking sector by heterogeneous groups in financial economics and analysis of education's effect on earned income in labor economics. The package MitISEM provides also an extended algorithm, 'sequential MitISEM', which substantially decreases computation time when the target density has to be approximated for increasing data samples. This occurs when the posterior or predictive density is updated with new observations and/or when one computes model probabilities using predictive likelihoods. We illustrate the MitISEM algorithm using three canonical statistical and econometric models that are characterized by several types of non-elliptical posterior shapes and that describe well-known data patterns in econometrics and finance. We show that MH using the candidate density obtained by MitISEM outperforms, in terms of numerical efficiency, MH using a simpler candidate, as well as the Gibbs sampler. The MitISEM approach is also used for Bayesian model comparison using predictive likelihoods.","This paper introduces the package gmnl in R for estimation of multinomial logit models with unobserved heterogeneity across individuals for cross-sectional and panel (longitudinal) data. Unobserved heterogeneity is modeled by allowing the parameters to vary randomly over individuals according to a continuous, discrete, or discrete-continuous mixture distribution, which must be chosen a priori by the researcher. In particular, the models supported by gmnl are the multinomial or conditional logit, the mixed multinomial logit, the scale heterogeneity multinomial logit, the generalized multinomial logit, the latent class logit, and the mixed-mixed multinomial logit. These models are estimated using either the maximum likelihood estimator or the maximum simulated likelihood estimator. This article describes and illustrates with real databases all functionalities of gmnl, including the derivation of individual conditional estimates of both the random parameters and willingness-to-pay measures.","The Stata package krls as well as the R package KRLS implement kernel-based regularized least squares (KRLS), a machine learning method described in Hainmueller and Hazlett (2014) that allows users to tackle regression and classification problems without strong functional form assumptions or a specification search. The flexible KRLS estimator learns the functional form from the data, thereby protecting inferences against misspecification bias. Yet it nevertheless allows for interpretability and inference in ways similar to ordinary regression models. In particular, KRLS provides closed-form estimates for the predicted values, variances, and the pointwise partial derivatives that characterize the marginal effects of each independent variable at each data point in the covariate space. The method is thus a convenient and powerful alternative to ordinary least squares and other generalized linear models for regression-based analyses.","Given a vectorial data set in two dimensions, a representation on a complex domain is often convenient. This representation is rarely considered in geostatistics, although interesting applications can be found in environmental sciences and meteorology (e.g., for wind fields). In such a case, some computational difficulties are related to the lack of software for estimating and modeling a complex covariance function, for predicting complex variables as well as for representing the output results. In this paper, the new Fortran software cgeostat for geostatistical analysis of complex-valued random fields is presented and an application is demonstrated.","The irreversible illness-death model describes the pathway from an initial state to an absorbing state either directly or through an intermediate state. This model is frequently used in medical applications where the intermediate state represents illness and the absorbing state represents death. In many studies, disease onset times are not known exactly. This happens for example if the disease status of a patient can only be assessed at follow-up visits. In this situation the disease onset times are interval-censored. This article presents the SmoothHazard package for R. It implements algorithms for simultaneously fitting regression models to the three transition intensities of an illness-death model where the transition times to the intermediate state may be interval-censored and all the event times can be right-censored. The package parses the individual data structure of the subjects in a data set to find the individual contributions to the likelihood. The three baseline transition intensity functions are modelled by Weibull distributions or alternatively by M -splines in a semi-parametric approach. For a given set of covariates, the estimated transition intensities can be combined into predictions of cumulative event probabilities and life expectancies.","Thousands of chemicals have been profiled by high-throughput screening programs such as ToxCast and Tox21; these chemicals are tested in part because most of them have limited or no data on hazard, exposure, or toxicokinetics. Toxicokinetic models aid in predicting tissue concentrations resulting from chemical exposure, and a \"reverse dosimetry\" approach can be used to predict exposure doses sufficient to cause tissue concentrations that have been identified as bioactive by high-throughput screening. We have created four toxicokinetic models within the R software package httk. These models are designed to be parameterized using high-throughput in vitro data (plasma protein binding and hepatic clearance), as well as structure-derived physicochemical properties and species-specific physiological data. The package contains tools for Monte Carlo sampling and reverse dosimetry along with functions for the analysis of concentration vs. time simulations. The package can currently use human in vitro data to make predictions for 553 chemicals in humans, rats, mice, dogs, and rabbits, including 94 pharmaceuticals and 415 ToxCast chemicals. For 67 of these chemicals, the package includes rat-specific in vitro data. This package is structured to be augmented with additional chemical data as they become available. Package httk enables the inclusion of toxicokinetics in the statistical analysis of chemicals undergoing high-throughput screening.","The package npbr is the first free specialized software for data edge and frontier analysis in the statistical literature. It provides a variety of functions for the best known and most innovative approaches to nonparametric boundary estimation. The selected methods are concerned with empirical, smoothed, unrestricted as well as constrained fits under both single and multiple shape constraints. They also cover data envelopment techniques as well as robust approaches to outliers. The routines included in npbr are user friendly and afford a large degree of flexibility in the estimation specifications. They provide smoothing parameter selection for the modern local linear and polynomial spline methods as well as for some promising extreme value techniques. Also, they seamlessly allow for Monte Carlo comparisons among the implemented estimation procedures. This package will be very useful for statisticians and applied researchers interested in employing nonparametric boundary regression models. Its use is illustrated with a number of empirical applications and simulated examples.","This paper presents the gretl function package DPB for estimating dynamic binary models with panel data. The package contains routines for the estimation of the randomeffects dynamic probit model proposed by Heckman (1981b) and its generalisation by Hyslop (1999) and Keane and Sauer (2009) to accommodate AR(1) disturbances. The fixed-effects estimator by Bartolucci and Nigro (2010) is also implemented. DPB is available on the gretl function packages archive.","The production of synthetic datasets has been proposed as a statistical disclosure control solution to generate public use files out of protected data, and as a tool to create \"augmented datasets\" to serve as input for micro-simulation models. Synthetic data have become an important instrument for ex-ante assessments of policy impact. The performance and acceptability of such a tool relies heavily on the quality of the synthetic populations, i.e., on the statistical similarity between the synthetic and the true population of interest. Multiple approaches and tools have been developed to generate synthetic data. These approaches can be categorized into three main groups: synthetic reconstruction, combinatorial optimization, and model-based generation. We provide in this paper a brief overview of these approaches, and introduce simPop, an open source data synthesizer. simPop is a user-friendly R package based on a modular object-oriented concept. It provides a highly optimized S4 class implementation of various methods, including calibration by iterative proportional fitting and simulated annealing, and modeling or data fusion by logistic regression. We demonstrate the use of simPop by creating a synthetic population of Austria, and report on the utility of the resulting data. We conclude with suggestions for further development of the package.","The brms package implements Bayesian multilevel models in R using the probabilistic programming language Stan. A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit  -  among others  -  linear, robust linear, binomial, Poisson, survival, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even non-linear models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include autocorrelation of the response variable, user defined covariance structures, censored data, as well as meta-analytic standard errors. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their beliefs. In addition, model fit can easily be assessed and compared with the Watanabe-Akaike information criterion and leave-one-out cross-validation.","The saemix package for R provides maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in nonlinear mixed effect models, using a modern and efficient estimation algorithm, the stochastic approximation expectation maximisation (SAEM) algorithm. In the present paper we describe the main features of the package, and apply it to several examples to illustrate its use. Making use of S4 classes and methods to provide user-friendly interaction, this package provides a new estimation tool to the R community.","Network meta-analysis is a powerful approach for synthesizing direct and indirect evidence about multiple treatment comparisons from a collection of independent studies. At present, the most widely used method in network meta-analysis is contrast-based, in which a baseline treatment needs to be specified in each study, and the analysis focuses on modeling relative treatment effects (typically log odds ratios). However, populationaveraged treatment-specific parameters, such as absolute risks, cannot be estimated by this method without an external data source or a separate model for a reference treatment. Recently, an arm-based network meta-analysis method has been proposed, and the R package pcnetmeta provides user-friendly functions for its implementation. This package estimates both absolute and relative effects, and can handle binary, continuous, and count outcomes.","The tree-based TVCM algorithm and its implementation in the R package vcrpart are introduced for generalized linear models. The purpose of TVCM is to learn whether and how the coefficients of a regression model vary by moderating variables. A separate partition is built for each potentially varying coefficient, allowing the user to specify coefficient-specific sets of potential moderators, and allowing the algorithm to select moderators individually by coefficient. In addition to describing the algorithm, the TVCM is evaluated using a benchmark comparison and a simulation study and the R commands are demonstrated by means of empirical applications.","In this paper we show how to simulate and estimate a COGARCH(p, q) model in the R package yuima. Several routines for simulation and estimation are introduced. In particular, for the generation of a COGARCH(p, q) trajectory, the user can choose between two alternative schemes. The first is based on the Euler discretization of the stochastic differential equations that identify a COGARCH(p, q) model while the second considers the explicit solution of the equations defining the variance process. Estimation is based on the matching of the empirical with the theoretical autocorrelation function. Three different approaches are implemented: minimization of the mean squared error, minimization of the absolute mean error and the generalized method of moments where the weighting matrix is continuously updated. Numerical examples are given in order to explain methods and classes used in the yuima package.","Personalized medicine, whereby treatments are tailored to a specific patient rather than a general disease or condition, is an area of growing interest in the fields of biostatistics, epidemiology, and beyond. Dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) are an integral part of this framework, allowing for personalized treatment of patients with long-term conditions while accounting for both their present circumstances and medical history. The identification of the optimal DTR in any given context, however, is a non-trivial problem, and so specialized methodologies have been developed for that purpose. Here we introduce the R package DTRreg which implements two regression-based approaches: G-estimation and dynamic weighted ordinary least squares regression. We outline the theory underlying these methods, discuss the implementation of DTRreg and demonstrate its use with hypothetical and real-world inspired simulated datasets.","The statistically equivalent signature (SES) algorithm is a method for feature selection inspired by the principles of constraint-based learning of Bayesian networks. Most of the currently available feature selection methods return only a single subset of features, supposedly the one with the highest predictive power. We argue that in several domains multiple subsets can achieve close to maximal predictive accuracy, and that arbitrarily providing only one has several drawbacks. The SES method attempts to identify multiple, predictive feature subsets whose performances are statistically equivalent. In that respect the SES algorithm subsumes and extends previous feature selection algorithms, like the max-min parent children algorithm. The SES algorithm is implemented in an homonym function included in the R package MXM, standing for mens ex machina, meaning 'mind from the machine' in Latin. The MXM implementation of SES handles several data analysis tasks, namely classification, regression and survival analysis. In this paper we present the SES algorithm, its implementation, and provide examples of use of the SES function in R. Furthermore, we analyze three publicly available data sets to illustrate the equivalence of the signatures retrieved by SES and to contrast SES against the state-of-the-art feature selection method LASSO. Our results provide initial evidence that the two methods perform comparably well in terms of predictive accuracy and that multiple, equally predictive signatures are actually present in real world data.","Extensions in the field of joint modeling of correlated data and dynamic predictions improve the development of prognosis research. The R package frailtypack provides estimations of various joint models for longitudinal data and survival events. In particular, it fits models for recurrent events and a terminal event (frailtyPenal), models for two survival outcomes for clustered data (frailtyPenal), models for two types of recurrent events and a terminal event (multivPenal), models for a longitudinal biomarker and a terminal event (longiPenal) and models for a longitudinal biomarker, recurrent events and a terminal event (trivPenal). The estimators are obtained using a standard and penalized maximum likelihood approach, each model function allows to evaluate goodness-of-fit analyses and provides plots of baseline hazard functions. Finally, the package provides individual dynamic predictions of the terminal event and evaluation of predictive accuracy. This paper presents the theoretical models with estimation techniques, applies the methods for predictions and illustrates frailtypack functions details with examples.","In recent years, targeted minimum loss-based estimation methodology has been used to develop estimators of parameters in longitudinal data structures (Gruber and van der Laan 2012; Petersen, Schwab, Gruber, Blaser, Schomaker, and van der Laan 2014; Schnitzer, Moodie, van der Laan, Platt, and Klein 2013). These methods are implemented in the ltmle package for R. The ltmle package provides methods to estimate intervention-specific means and measures of association including the average treatment effect, causal odds ratio and causal risk ratio and parameters of a longitudinal working marginal structural model. The package allows for multiple time point treatments, time-varying covariates and right censoring of the outcome. In this paper we described the usage of the ltmle package and provide examples.","Latent Markov (LM) models represent an important class of models for the analysis of longitudinal data, especially when response variables are categorical. These models have a great potential of application in many fields, such as economics and medicine. We illustrate the R package LMest that is tailored to deal with the basic LM model and some extended formulations accounting for individual covariates and for the presence of unobserved clusters of units having the same initial and transition probabilities (mixed LM model). The main functions of the package are tailored to parameter estimation through the expectation-maximization algorithm, which is based on suitable forwardbackward recursions. The package also permits local and global decoding and to obtain standard errors for the parameter estimates. We illustrate the use of the package and its main features through some empirical examples in the fields of labour market, health, and criminology.","The condvis package is for interactive visualization of sections in data space, showing fitted models on the section, and observed data near the section. The primary goal is the interpretation of complex models, and showing how the observed data support the fitted model. There is a video accompaniment to this paper available at https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKFq7xwgdX0.","The simcausal R package is a tool for specification and simulation of complex longitudinal data structures that are based on non-parametric structural equation models. The package aims to provide a flexible tool for simplifying the conduct of transparent and reproducible simulation studies, with a particular emphasis on the types of data and interventions frequently encountered in real-world causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The package interface allows for concise expression of complex functional dependencies between a large number of nodes, where each node may represent a measurement at a specific time point. The package allows for specification and simulation of counterfactual data under various user-specified interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic). In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events. Finally, the package enables the computation of a selected set of user-specified features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. The applicability of simcausal is demonstrated by replicating the results of two published simulation studies.","SFAMB is a flexible econometric tool designed for the estimation of stochastic frontier models. Ox is a matrix language used in different modules, with a console version freely available to academic users. This article provides a brief introduction to the field of stochastic frontier analysis, with examples of code (input and output) as well as a technical documentation of member functions. SFAMB provides frontier models for both crosssectional data and panel data (focusing on fixed effects models). Member functions can be extended depending on the needs of the user.","This paper introduces intsvy, an R package for working with international assessment data (e.g., PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS). The package includes functions for importing data, performing data analysis, and visualizing results. The paper describes the underlying methodology and provides real data examples. Tools for importing data allow useRs to select variables from student, home, school, and teacher survey instruments as well as for specific countries. Data analysis functions take into account the complex sample design (with replicate weights) and rotated test forms (with plausible values of achievement scores) in the calculation of point estimates and standard errors of means, standard deviations, regression coefficients, correlation coefficients, and frequency tables. Visualization tools present data aggregates in standardized graphical form.","Count and proportion data may present overdispersion, i.e., greater variability than expected by the Poisson and binomial models, respectively. Different extended generalized linear models that allow for overdispersion may be used to analyze this type of data, such as models that use a generalized variance function, random-effects models, zero-inflated models and compound distribution models. Assessing goodness-of-fit and verifying assumptions of these models is not an easy task and the use of half-normal plots with a simulated envelope is a possible solution for this problem. These plots are a useful indicator of goodness-of-fit that may be used with any generalized linear model and extensions. For GLIM users, functions that generated these plots were widely used, however, in the open-source software R, these functions were not yet available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). We describe a new package in R, hnp, that may be used to generate the half-normal plot with a simulated envelope for residuals from different types of models. The function hnp() can be used together with a range of different model fitting packages in R that extend the basic generalized linear model fitting in glm() and is written so that it is relatively easy to extend it to new model classes and different diagnostics. We illustrate its use on a range of examples, including continuous and discrete responses, and show how it can be used to inform model selection and diagnose overdispersion.","The R package nopp enables computing party/candidate ideological positions that correspond to a Nash equilibrium along a one-dimensional space. It accommodates alternative motivations in (each) party strategy while allowing estimation of the uncertainty around their optimal positions through Monte Carlo or bootstrap procedures.","In spite of the interest in and appeal of convolution-based approaches for nonstationary spatial modeling, off-the-shelf software for model fitting does not as of yet exist. Convolution-based models are highly flexible yet notoriously difficult to fit, even with relatively small data sets. The general lack of pre-packaged options for model fitting makes it difficult to compare new methodology in nonstationary modeling with other existing methods, and as a result most new models are simply compared to stationary models. Using a convolution-based approach, we present a new nonstationary covariance function for spatial Gaussian process models that allows for efficient computing in two ways: first, by representing the spatially-varying parameters via a discrete mixture or \"mixture component\" model, and second, by estimating the mixture component parameters through a local likelihood approach. In order to make computations for a convolutionbased nonstationary spatial model readily available, this paper also presents and describes the convoSPAT package for R. The nonstationary model is fit to both a synthetic data set and a real data application involving annual precipitation to demonstrate the capabilities of the package.","In clinical phase II studies, the efficacy of a promising therapy is tested in patients for the first time. Based on the results, it is decided whether the development programme should be stopped or whether the benefit-risk profile is promising enough to justify the initiation of large phase III studies. In oncology, phase II trials are commonly conducted as single-arm trials with planned interim analyses to allow for an early stopping for futility. The specification of an adequate study design that guarantees control of the type I and II error rates is a key task in the planning stage of such a trial. A variety of statistical methods exists which can be used to optimise the planning and analysis of such studies. However, there are currently neither commercial nor non-commercial software tools available that support the practical application of these methods comprehensively. The R package OneArmPhaseTwoStudy was implemented to fill this gap. The package allows determining an adequate study design for the particular situation at hand as well as monitoring the progress of the study and evaluating the results with valid and efficient analyses methods. This article describes the features of the R package and its application.","Latent class is a method for classifying subjects, originally based on binary outcome data but now extended to other data types. A major difficulty with the use of latent class models is the presence of heterogeneity of the outcome probabilities within the true classes, which violates the assumption of conditional independence, and will require a large number of classes to model the association in the data resulting in difficulties in interpretation. A solution is to include a normally distributed subject level random effect in the model so that the outcomes are now conditionally independent given both the class and random effect. A further extension is to incorporate an additional period level random effect when subjects are observed over time. The use of the randomLCA R package is demonstrated on three latent class examples: classification of subjects based on myocardial infarction symptoms, a diagnostic testing approach to comparing dentists in the diagnosis of dental caries and classification of infants based on respiratory and allergy symptoms over time.","The non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator and semi-parametric regression models are fundamental estimators for interval censored data, along with standard fullyparametric regression models. The R package icenReg is introduced which contains fast, reliable algorithms for fitting these models. In addition, the package contains functions for imputation of the censored response variables and diagnostics of both regression effects and baseline distribution.","In this paper, we develop generalized hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA, to assist experimental researchers in the behavioral and social sciences in the analysis of experiments with within- and between-subjects factors. The method alleviates several limitations of classical ANOVA, still commonly employed in those fields of research. An accompanying R Package for BANOVA is developed. It offers statistical routines and several easy-to-use functions for estimation of hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA models that are tailored to the analysis of experimental research. MCMC simulation is used to simulate posterior samples of the parameters of each model specified by the user. The core program is written in R and JAGS. After preparing the data in the required format, users simply select an appropriate model, and can estimate it without any advanced coding being required. The main aim of the R package is to offer freely accessible resources for hierarchical Bayesian ANOVA analysis, which makes it easy to use for applied researchers.","In causal inference, interference occurs when the treatment of one subject affects the outcome of other subjects. Interference can distort research conclusions about causal effects when not accounted for properly. In the absence of interference, inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators are commonly used to estimate causal effects from observational data. Recently, IPW estimators have been extended to handle interference. Tchetgen Tchetgen and VanderWeele (2012) proposed IPW methods to estimate direct and indirect (or spillover) effects that allow for interference between individuals within groups. In this paper, we present inferference, an R package that computes these IPW causal effect estimates when interference may be present within groups. We illustrate use of the package with examples from political science and infectious disease.","We introduce an R package that estimates decision thresholds in diagnostic settings with a continuous marker and two or three underlying states. The package implements parametric and non-parametric estimation methods based on minimizing an overall cost function, as well as confidence interval estimation approaches to account for the sampling variability of the cut-off. Further features of the package include sample size determination and estimation of diagnostic accuracy measures. We used randomly generated data and two real datasets to illustrate the capabilities and characteristics of the package.","The different robust estimators for the standard errors of panel models used in applied econometric practice can all be written and computed as combinations of the same simple building blocks. A framework based on high-level wrapper functions for most common usage and basic computational elements to be combined at will, coupling user-friendliness with flexibility, is integrated in the plm package for panel data econometrics in R. Statistical motivation and computational approach are reviewed, and applied examples are provided.","Science depends on collaboration, result reproduction, and the development of supporting software tools. Each of these requires careful management of software versions. We present a unified model for installing, managing, and publishing software contexts in R. It introduces the package manifest as a central data structure for representing versionspecific, decentralized package cohorts. The manifest points to package sources on arbitrary hosts and in various forms, including tarballs and directories under version control. We provide a high-level interface for creating and switching between side-by-side package libraries derived from manifests. Finally, we extend package installation to support the retrieval of exact package versions as indicated by manifests, and to maintain provenance for installed packages. The provenance information enables the user to publish libraries or sessions as manifests, hence completing the loop between publication and deployment. We have implemented this model across three software packages, switchr, switchrGist and GRANBase, and have released the source code under the Artistic 2.0 license.","The vdmR package generates web-based visual data mining tools by adding interactive functions to ggplot2 graphics. Brushing and linking between multiple plots is one of the main features of this package. Currently, scatter plots, histograms, parallel coordinate plots, and choropleth maps are supported in the vdmR package. In addition, identification on a plot is supported by linking the plot and the data table.","The R package tscount provides likelihood-based estimation methods for analysis and modeling of count time series following generalized linear models. This is a flexible class of models which can describe serial correlation in a parsimonious way. The conditional mean of the process is linked to its past values, to past observations and to potential covariate effects. The package allows for models with the identity and with the logarithmic link function. The conditional distribution can be Poisson or negative binomial. An important special case of this class is the so-called INGARCH model and its log-linear extension. The package includes methods for model fitting and assessment, prediction and intervention analysis. This paper summarizes the theoretical background of these methods. It gives details on the implementation of the package and provides simulation results for models which have not been studied theoretically before. The usage of the package is illustrated by two data examples. Additionally, we provide a review of R packages which can be used for count time series analysis. This includes a detailed comparison of tscount to those packages.","Models of unobserved heterogeneity, or frailty as it is commonly known in survival analysis, can often be formulated as semiparametric mixture models and estimated by maximum likelihood as proposed by Robbins (1950) and elaborated by Kiefer and Wolfowitz (1956). Recent developments in convex optimization, as noted by Koenker and Mizera (2014b), have led to dramatic improvements in computational methods for such models. In this vignette we describe an implementation contained in the R package REBayes with applications to a wide variety of mixture settings: Gaussian location and scale, Poisson and binomial mixtures for discrete data, Weibull and Gompertz models for survival data, and several Gaussian models intended for longitudinal data. While the dimension of the nonparametric heterogeneity of these models is inherently limited by our present gridding strategy, we describe how additional fixed parameters can be relatively easily accommodated via profile likelihood. We also describe some nonparametric maximum likelihood methods for shape and norm constrained density estimation that employ related computational methods.","Longitudinal studies commonly arise in various fields such as psychology, social science, economics and medical research, etc. It is of great importance to understand the dynamics in the mean function, covariance and/or correlation matrices of repeated measurements. However, high-dimensionality (HD) and positive-definiteness (PD) constraints are two major stumbling blocks in modeling of covariance and correlation matrices. It is evident that Cholesky-type decomposition based methods are effective in dealing with HD and PD problems, but those methods were not implemented in statistical software yet, causing a difficulty for practitioners to use. In this paper, we first introduce recently developed Cholesky decomposition based methods for joint modeling of mean and covariance structures, namely modified Cholesky decomposition (MCD), alternative Cholesky decomposition (ACD) and hyperspherical parameterization of Cholesky factor (HPC). We then introduce our newly developed R package jmcm which is currently able to handle longitudinal data that follows a Gaussian distribution using the MCD, ACD and HPC methods. The use of package jmcm is illustrated and a comparison of those methods is made through the analysis of two real datasets.","The use of GPS-enabled tracking devices and heart rate monitors is becoming increasingly common in sports and fitness activities. The trackeR package aims to fill the gap between the routine collection of data from such devices and their analyses in R. The package provides methods to import tracking data into data structures which preserve units of measurement and are organized in sessions. The package implements core infrastructure for relevant summaries and visualizations, as well as support for handling units of measurement. There are also methods for relevant analytic tools such as time spent in zones, work capacity above critical power (known as W 0 ), and distribution and concentration profiles. A case study illustrates how the latter can be used to summarize the information from training sessions and use it in more advanced statistical analyses.","Sparse Hessian matrices occur often in statistics, and their fast and accurate estimation can improve efficiency of numerical optimization and sampling algorithms. By exploiting the known sparsity pattern of a Hessian, methods in the sparseHessianFD package require many fewer function or gradient evaluations than would be required if the Hessian were treated as dense. The package implements established graph coloring and linear substitution algorithms that were previously unavailable to R users, and is most useful when other numerical, symbolic or algorithmic methods are impractical, inefficient or unavailable.","Everything that exists in R is an object (Chambers 2016). This article examines what would be possible if we kept copies of all R objects that have ever been created. Not only objects but also their properties, meta-data, relations with other objects and information about context in which they were created. We introduce archivist, an R package designed to improve the management of results of data analysis. Key functionalities of this package include: (i) management of local and remote repositories which contain R objects and their meta-data (objects' properties and relations between them); (ii) archiving R objects to repositories; (iii) sharing and retrieving objects (and their pedigree) by their unique hooks; (iv) searching for objects with specific properties or relations to other objects; (v) verification of object's identity and context of its creation. The presented archivist package extends, in a combination with packages such as knitr and the function Sweave, the reproducible research paradigm by creating new ways to retrieve and validate previously calculated objects. These new features give a variety of opportunities such as: sharing R objects within reports or articles; adding hooks to R objects in table or figure captions; interactive exploration of object repositories; caching function calls with their results; retrieving an object's pedigree (i.e., information about how the object was created); automated tracking of the performance of considered models, restoring R packages to the state in which the object was archived.","We present the R npregfast package via some applications involved with the study of living organisms. The package implements nonparametric estimation procedures in regression models with or without factor-by-curve interactions. The main feature of the package is its ability to perform inference regarding these models. Namely, the implementation of different procedures to test features of the estimated regression curves: on the one hand, the comparisons between curves which may vary across groups defined by levels of a categorical variable or factor; on the other hand, the comparisons of some critical points of the curve (e.g., maxima, minima or inflection points), studying for this purpose the derivatives of the curve.","One of the frequent questions by users of the mixed model function lmer of the lme4 package has been: How can I get p values for the F and t tests for objects returned by lmer? The lmerTest package extends the 'lmerMod' class of the lme4 package, by overloading the anova and summary functions by providing p values for tests for fixed effects. We have implemented the Satterthwaite's method for approximating degrees of freedom for the t and F tests. We have also implemented the construction of Type I - III ANOVA tables. Furthermore, one may also obtain the summary as well as the anova table using the Kenward-Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom (based on the KRmodcomp function from the pbkrtest package). Some other convenient mixed model analysis tools such as a step method, that performs backward elimination of nonsignificant effects  -  both random and fixed, calculation of population means and multiple comparison tests together with plot facilities are provided by the package as well.","An important step in modeling spatially-referenced data is appropriately specifying the second order properties of the random field. A scientist developing a model for spatial data has a number of options regarding the nature of the dependence between observations. One of these options is deciding whether or not the dependence between observations depends on direction, or, in other words, whether or not the spatial covariance function is isotropic. Isotropy implies that spatial dependence is a function of only the distance and not the direction of the spatial separation between sampling locations. A researcher may use graphical techniques, such as directional sample semivariograms, to determine whether an assumption of isotropy holds. These graphical diagnostics can be difficult to assess, subject to personal interpretation, and potentially misleading as they typically do not include a measure of uncertainty. In order to escape these issues, a hypothesis test of the assumption of isotropy may be more desirable. To avoid specification of the covariance function, a number of nonparametric tests of isotropy have been developed using both the spatial and spectral representations of random fields. Several of these nonparametric tests are implemented in the R package spTest, available on CRAN. We demonstrate how graphical techniques and the hypothesis tests programmed in package spTest can be used in practice to assess isotropy properties.","This paper presents the R package EMMIXcskew for the fitting of the canonical fundamental skew t-distribution (CFUST) and finite mixtures of CFUST distributions (FMCFUST) via maximum likelihood (ML). The CFUST distribution provides a flexible family to model non-normal data, with parameters for capturing skewness and heavy-tails in the data. It formally encompasses the normal, t, and skew normal distributions as special and/or limiting cases. A few other versions of the skew t-distributions are also nested within the CFUST distribution. In this paper, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is described for computing the ML estimates of the parameters of the FM-CFUST model, and different strategies for initializing the algorithm are discussed and illustrated. The methodology is implemented in the EMMIXcskew package, and examples are presented using two real datasets. The EMMIXcskew package contains functions to fit the FM-CFUST model, including procedures for generating different initial values. Additional features include random sample generation and contour visualization in 2D and 3D.","This paper introduces the R package meta4diag for implementing Bayesian bivariate meta-analyses of diagnostic test studies. Our package meta4diag is a purpose-built front end of the R package INLA. While INLA offers full Bayesian inference for the large set of latent Gaussian models using integrated nested Laplace approximations, meta4diag extracts the features needed for bivariate meta-analysis and presents them in an intuitive way. It allows the user a straightforward model specification and offers user-specific prior distributions. Further, the newly proposed penalized complexity prior framework is supported, which builds on prior intuitions about the behaviors of the variance and correlation parameters. Accurate posterior marginal distributions for sensitivity and specificity as well as all hyperparameters, and covariates are directly obtained without Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Further, univariate estimates of interest, such as odds ratios, as well as the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and other common graphics are directly available for interpretation. An interactive graphical user interface provides the user with the full functionality of the package without requiring any R programming. The package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=meta4diag/ and its usage will be illustrated using three real data examples.","We revisit sure independence screening procedures for variable selection in generalized linear models and the Cox proportional hazards model. Through the publicly available R package SIS, we provide a unified environment to carry out variable selection using iterative sure independence screening (ISIS) and all of its variants. For the regularization steps in the ISIS recruiting process, available penalties include the LASSO, SCAD, and MCP while the implemented variants for the screening steps are sample splitting, data-driven thresholding, and combinations thereof. Performance of these feature selection techniques is investigated by means of real and simulated data sets, where we find considerable improvements in terms of model selection and computational time between our algorithms and traditional penalized pseudo-likelihood methods applied directly to the full set of covariates.","The xergm package is an implementation of extensions to the exponential random graph model (ERGM). It acts as a meta-package for multiple constituent packages. One of these packages is btergm, which implements bootstrap methods for the temporal ERGM estimated by maximum pseudolikelihood. Here, we illustrate the temporal exponential random graph model and its implementation in the package btergm using data on international alliances and a longitudinally observed friendship network in a Dutch school.","PPtreeViz, an R package, was developed to explore projection pursuit methods for classification. It provides functions to calculate various projection pursuit indices for classification and to explore the results in the space of projection. It also provides functions for the projection pursuit classification tree. The visualization methods of the tree structure and the features of each node in PPtreeViz can be used to easily explore the projection pursuit classification tree structure and determine the characteristics of each class. To calculate the projection pursuit indices and optimize these indices, we use the Rcpp and RcppArmadillo packages in R to improve the speed.","In this paper the R package TP.idm to compute an empirical transition probability matrix for the illness-death model is introduced. This package implements a novel nonparametric estimator which is particularly well suited for non-Markov processes observed under right censoring. Variance estimates and confidence limits are also implemented in the package.","We present the R package epinet, which provides tools for analyzing the spread of epidemics through populations. We assume that the relationships among individuals in a population are modeled by a contact network described by an exponential-family random graph model and that the disease being studied spreads across the edges of this network from infectious to susceptible individuals. We use a susceptible-exposed-infectiousremoved compartmental model to describe the progress of the disease within each host. We describe the functionality of the package, which consists of routines that perform simulation, plotting, and inference. The main inference routine utilizes a Bayesian approach and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We demonstrate the use of the package through two examples, one involving simulated data and one using data from an actual measles outbreak.","The teigen R package is introduced and utilized for model-based clustering and classification. The tEIGEN family of mixtures of multivariate t distributions is formed via an eigen-decomposition of the component covariance matrices and subsequent componentwise constraints. The teigen package implements all previously published tEIGEN family members as well as eight additional models: four multivariate and four univariate. The resulting family of 32 mixture models is implemented in both serial and parallel, with useful dedicated functions. Methodology and examples that illustrate teigen's functionality are presented.","Multivariate survival trees require few statistical assumptions, are easy to interpret, and provide meaningful diagnosis and prediction rules. Trees can handle a large number of predictors with mixed types and do not require predictor variable transformation or selection. These are useful features in many application fields and are often required in the current era of big data. The aim of this article is to introduce the R package MST. This package constructs multivariate survival trees using marginal model and frailty model based approaches. It allows the user to control and see how the trees are constructed. The package can also simulate high-dimensional, multivariate survival data from marginal and frailty models.","In this paper we discuss the challenge of equitably combining continuous (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative) variables for the purpose of cluster analysis. Existing techniques require strong parametric assumptions, or difficult-to-specify tuning parameters. We describe the kamila package, which includes a weighted k-means approach to clustering mixed-type data, a method for estimating weights for mixed-type data (ModhaSpangler weighting), and an additional semiparametric method recently proposed in the literature (KAMILA). We include a discussion of strategies for estimating the number of clusters in the data, and describe the implementation of one such method in the current R package. Background and usage of these clustering methods are presented. We then show how the KAMILA algorithm can be adapted to a map-reduce framework, and implement the resulting algorithm using Hadoop for clustering very large mixed-type data sets.","In this paper we mirror the framework of generalized (non-)linear models to define the family of generalized age-period-cohort stochastic mortality models which encompasses the vast majority of stochastic mortality projection models proposed to date, including the well-known Lee-Carter and Cairns-Blake-Dowd models. We also introduce the R package StMoMo which exploits the unifying framework of the generalized age-period-cohort family to provide tools for fitting stochastic mortality models, assessing their goodnessof-fit and performing mortality projections. We illustrate some of the capabilities of the package by performing a comparison of several stochastic mortality models applied to the England and Wales population.","Finite mixture modeling provides a framework for cluster analysis based on parsimonious Gaussian mixture models. Variable or feature selection is of particular importance in situations where only a subset of the available variables provide clustering information. This enables the selection of a more parsimonious model, yielding more efficient estimates, a clearer interpretation and, often, improved clustering partitions. This paper describes the R package clustvarsel which performs subset selection for model-based clustering. An improved version of the Raftery and Dean (2006) methodology is implemented in the new release of the package to find the (locally) optimal subset of variables with group/cluster information in a dataset. Search over the solution space is performed using either a stepwise greedy search or a headlong algorithm. Adjustments for speeding up these algorithms are discussed, as well as a parallel implementation of the stepwise search. Usage of the package is presented through the discussion of several data examples.","Cox's regression model for the analysis of survival data relies on the proportional hazards assumption. However, this assumption is often violated in practice and as a consequence the average relative risk may be under- or overestimated. Weighted estimation of Cox regression is a parsimonious alternative which supplies well interpretable average effects also in case of non-proportional hazards. We provide the R package coxphw implementing weighted Cox regression. By means of two biomedical examples appropriate analyses in the presence of non-proportional hazards are exemplified and advantages of weighted Cox regression are discussed. Moreover, using package coxphw, time-dependent effects can be conveniently estimated by including interactions of covariates with arbitrary functions of time.","This article describes the R package mcglm implemented for fitting multivariate covariance generalized linear models (McGLMs). McGLMs provide a general statistical modeling framework for normal and non-normal multivariate data analysis, designed to handle multivariate response variables, along with a wide range of temporal and spatial correlation structures defined in terms of a covariance link function and a matrix linear predictor involving known symmetric matrices. The models take non-normality into account in the conventional way by means of a variance function, and the mean structure is modeled by means of a link function and a linear predictor. The models are fitted using an estimating function approach based on second-moment assumptions. This provides a unified approach to a wide variety of different types of response variables and covariance structures, including multivariate extensions of repeated measures, time series, longitudinal, genetic, spatial and spatio-temporal structures. The mcglm package allows a flexible specification of the mean and covariance structures, and explicitly deals with multivariate response variables, through a user friendly formula interface similar to the ordinary glm function. Illustrations in this article cover a wide range of applications from the traditional one response variable Gaussian mixed models to multivariate spatial models for areal data using the multivariate Tweedie distribution. Additional features, such as robust and bias-corrected standard errors for regression parameters, residual analysis, measures of goodness-of-fit and model selection using the score information criterion are discussed through six worked examples. The mcglm package is a full R implementation based on the Matrix package which provides efficient access to BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines), Lapack (dense matrix), TAUCS (sparse matrix) and UMFPACK (sparse matrix) routines for efficient linear algebra in R.","evmix is an R package (R Core Team 2017) with two interlinked toolsets: i) for extreme value modeling and ii) kernel density estimation. A key issue in univariate extreme value modeling is the choice of threshold beyond which the asymptotically motivated extreme value models provide a suitable tail approximation. The package implements almost all existing extreme value mixture models, which permit objective threshold estimation and uncertainty quantification. Some traditional diagnostic plots for threshold choice are provided. Kernel density estimation with a range of kernels is provided, including cross-validation maximum likelihood inference for the bandwidth. A key contribution over existing kernel smoothing packages in R is that a wide range of boundary corrected kernel density estimators are implemented, which are designed for populations with bounded support. These non-parametric density estimators are also incorporated into the extreme value mixture model framework to describe the density below the threshold. The quartet of density, distribution, quantile and random number generation functions is provided along with parameter estimation by likelihood inference and standard model fit diagnostics, for both the mixture models and kernel density estimators. The key features of the mixture models and (boundary corrected) kernel density estimators are described and their implementation using the package demonstrated.","Package EpiModel provides tools for building, simulating, and analyzing mathematical models for the population dynamics of infectious disease transmission in R. Several classes of models are included, but the unique contribution of this software package is a general stochastic framework for modeling the spread of epidemics on networks. EpiModel integrates recent advances in statistical methods for network analysis (temporal exponential random graph models) that allow the epidemic modeling to be grounded in empirical data on contacts that can spread infection. This article provides an overview of both the modeling tools built into EpiModel, designed to facilitate learning for students new to modeling, and the application programming interface for extending package EpiModel, designed to facilitate the exploration of novel research questions for advanced modelers.","We describe the R package kdecopula (current version 0.9.2), which provides fast implementations of various kernel estimators for the copula density. Due to a variety of available plotting options it is particularly useful for the exploratory analysis of dependence structures. It can be further used for accurate nonparametric estimation of copula densities and resampling. The implementation features spline interpolation of the estimates to allow for fast evaluation of density estimates and integrals thereof. We utilize this for a fast renormalization scheme that ensures that estimates are bona fide copula densities and additionally improves the estimators' accuracy. The performance of the methods is illustrated by simulations.","Thematic maps show spatial distributions. The theme refers to the phenomena that is shown, which is often demographical, social, cultural, or economic. The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.","Spatial data relating to non-overlapping areal units are prevalent in fields such as economics, environmental science, epidemiology and social science, and a large suite of modeling tools have been developed for analysing these data. Many utilize conditional autoregressive (CAR) priors to capture the spatial autocorrelation inherent in these data, and software packages such as CARBayes and R-INLA have been developed to make these models easily accessible to others. Such spatial data are typically available for multiple time periods, and the development of methodology for capturing temporally changing spatial dynamics is the focus of much current research. A sizeable proportion of this literature has focused on extending CAR priors to the spatio-temporal domain, and this article presents the R package CARBayesST, which is the first dedicated software package for spatio-temporal areal unit modeling with conditional autoregressive priors. The software package allows to fit a range of models focused on different aspects of spacetime modeling, including estimation of overall space and time trends, and the identification of clusters of areal units that exhibit elevated values. This paper outlines the class of models that the software package implement, before applying them to simulated and two real examples from the fields of epidemiology and housing market analysis.","Applications in biotechnology such as gene expression analysis and image processing have led to a tremendous development of statistical methods with emphasis on reliable solutions to severely underdetermined systems. Furthermore, interpretations of such solutions are of importance, meaning that the surplus of inputs has been reduced to a concise model. At the core of this development are methods which augment the standard linear models for regression, classification and decomposition such that sparse solutions are obtained. This toolbox aims at making public available carefully implemented and well-tested variants of the most popular of such methods for the MATLAB programming environment. These methods consist of easy-to-read yet efficient implementations of various coefficient-path following algorithms and implementations of sparse principal component analysis and sparse discriminant analysis which are not available in MATLAB. The toolbox builds on code made public in 2005 and which has since been used in several studies.","In clinical research subjects are usually observed during a period of time. Primary and secondary endpoints are often either responses measured longitudinally over time or the time at which an event of interest occurs. Joint modeling is increasingly being used for multiple purposes such as to adjust the analysis of the longitudinal response for informative dropout mechanisms. In this paper we present %JM, a SAS macro that fits jointly generalized mixed models for longitudinal data and proportional hazards models for time-to-event responses. The macro fits normal, binary, binomial and Poisson longitudinal responses and allows choosing among a range of options to fit the trajectories of the longitudinal response over time: a linear function, splines, natural cubic splines and B-splines. For the time-to-event response, that might be right-censored, the macro fits parametric, stratified or not, proportional hazards models with the following baseline risk functions: exponential, Weibull, piecewise exponential and the generalizations of the Weibull and the Gompertz models based on splines. %JM offers several options to connect the longitudinal model and the time-to-event model: current-value-dependent and slope-dependent shared parameters, lagging effects, cumulative effects, random effects coefficients as shared parameters and interaction effects.","The randomized response (RR) technique was developed to improve the validity of measures assessing attitudes, behaviors, and attributes threatened by social desirability bias. The RR removes any direct link between individual responses and the sensitive attribute to maximize the anonymity of respondents and, in turn, to elicit more honest responding. Since multivariate analyses are no longer feasible using standard methods, we present the R package RRreg that allows for multivariate analyses of RR data in a user-friendly way. We show how to compute bivariate correlations, how to predict an RR variable in an adapted logistic regression framework (with or without random effects), and how to use RR predictors in a modified linear regression. In addition, the package allows for power analysis and robustness simulations. To facilitate the application of these methods, we illustrate the benefits of multivariate methods for RR variables using an empirical example.","We describe the R package hergm that implements hierarchical exponential-family random graph models with local dependence. Hierarchical exponential-family random graph models with local dependence tend to be superior to conventional exponential-family random graph models with global dependence in terms of goodness-of-fit. The advantage of hierarchical exponential-family random graph models is rooted in the local dependence induced by them. We discuss the notion of local dependence and the construction of models with local dependence along with model estimation, goodness-of-fit, and simulation. Simulation results and three applications are presented.","Stochastic simulation and modeling play an important role to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms in complex biochemical networks. The parametric sensitivity analysis of reaction networks becomes a powerful mathematical and computational tool, yielding information regarding the robustness and the identifiability of model parameters. However, due to overwhelming computational cost, parametric sensitivity analysis is a extremely challenging problem for stochastic models with a high-dimensional parameter space and for which existing approaches are very slow. Here we present an information-theoretic sensitivity analysis in path-space (ISAP) MATLAB package that simulates stochastic processes with various algorithms and most importantly implements a gradient-free approach to quantify the parameter sensitivities of stochastic chemical reaction network dynamics using the pathwise Fisher information matrix (PFIM; Pantazis, Katsoulakis, and Vlachos 2013). The sparse, block-diagonal structure of the PFIM makes its computational complexity scale linearly with the number of model parameters. As a result of the gradientfree and the sparse nature of the PFIM, it is highly suitable for the sensitivity analysis of stochastic reaction networks with a very large number of model parameters, which are typical in the modeling and simulation of complex biochemical phenomena. Finally, the PFIM provides a fast sensitivity screening method (Arampatzis, Katsoulakis, and Pantazis 2015) which allows it to be combined with any existing sensitivity analysis software.","This article describes blavaan, an R package for estimating Bayesian structural equation models (SEMs) via JAGS and for summarizing the results. It also describes a novel parameter expansion approach for estimating specific types of models with residual covariances, which facilitates estimation of these models in JAGS. The methodology and software are intended to provide users with a general means of estimating Bayesian SEMs, both classical and novel, in a straightforward fashion. Users can estimate Bayesian versions of classical SEMs with lavaan syntax, they can obtain state-of-the-art Bayesian fit measures associated with the models, and they can export JAGS code to modify the SEMs as desired. These features and more are illustrated by example, and the parameter expansion approach is explained in detail.","The R package DoE.base can be used for creating full factorial designs and general factorial experiments based on orthogonal arrays. Besides design creation, some analysis functionality is also available, particularly (augmented) half-normal effects plots. In addition to this specific functionality, the package provides convenience features for analyzing experimental designs and the infrastructure for a suite of further packages on designing and analyzing experiments. This infrastructure is available for use also by further design of experiments packages.","We considered Bayesian estimation of polygenic effects, in particular heritability in relation to a class of linear mixed models implemented in R (R Core Team 2018). Our approach is applicable to both family-based and population-based studies in human genetics with which a genetic relationship matrix can be derived either from family structure or genome-wide data. Using a simulated and a real data, we demonstrate our implementation of the models in the generic statistical software systems JAGS (Plummer 2017) and Stan (Carpenter et al. 2017) as well as several R packages. In doing so, we have not only provided facilities in R linking standalone programs such as GCTA (Yang, Lee, Goddard, and Visscher 2011) and other packages in R but also addressed some technical issues in the analysis. Our experience with a host of general and special software systems will facilitate investigation into more complex models for both human and nonhuman genetics.","In patient-centered outcomes research, it is essential to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) when making health care decisions for an individual patient or a group of patients. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to evaluate HTE based on information collected from clinical studies that are often designed and conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for the overall population. The Bayesian framework offers a principled and flexible approach to estimate and compare treatment effects across subgroups of patients defined by their characteristics. In this paper, we describe the package beanz which facilitates the conduct of Bayesian analysis of HTE by allowing users to explore a wide range of Bayesian HTE analysis models and produce posterior inferences about HTE. The package beanz also provides a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for users to conduct the Bayesian analysis of HTE in an interactive and user-friendly manner. With the GUI feature, package beanz can also be used by analysts not familiar with the R environment. We demonstrate package beanz using data from a randomized controlled trial on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor for treating congestive heart failure (N = 2569).","Randomization in clinical trials is the key design technique to ensure the comparability of treatment groups. Although there exist a large number of software products which assist the researcher to implement randomization, no tool which would cover a wide range of procedures and allow the comparative evaluation of the procedures under practical restrictions has been proposed in the literature so far. The R package randomizeR addresses this need. The paper includes a detailed description of the randomizeR package that serves as a tutorial for the generation of randomization sequences and the assessment of randomization procedures.","Clustering functional data is mostly based on the projection of the curves onto an adequate basis and building random effects models of the basis coefficients. The parameters can be fitted with an EM algorithm. Alternatively, distance models based on the coefficients are used in the literature. Similar to the case of clustering multidimensional data, a variety of derivations of different models has been published. Although their calculation procedure is similar, their implementations are very different including distinct hyperparameters and data formats as input. This makes it difficult for the user to apply and particularly to compare them. Furthermore, they are mostly limited to specific basis functions. This paper aims to show the common elements between existing models in highly cited articles, first on a theoretical basis. Later their implementation is analyzed and it is illustrated how they could be improved and extended to a more general level. A special consideration is given to those models designed for sparse measurements. The work resulted in the R package funcy which was built to integrate the modified and extended algorithms into a unique framework.","Supervised neural networks have been applied as a machine learning technique to identify and predict emergent patterns among multiple variables. A common criticism of these methods is the inability to characterize relationships among variables from a fitted model. Although several techniques have been proposed to \"illuminate the black box\", they have not been made available in an open-source programming environment. This article describes the NeuralNetTools package that can be used for the interpretation of supervised neural network models created in R. Functions in the package can be used to visualize a model using a neural network interpretation diagram, evaluate variable importance by disaggregating the model weights, and perform a sensitivity analysis of the response variables to changes in the input variables. Methods are provided for objects from many of the common neural network packages in R, including caret, neuralnet, nnet, and RSNNS. The article provides a brief overview of the theoretical foundation of neural networks, a description of the package structure and functions, and an applied example to provide a context for model development with NeuralNetTools. Overall, the package provides a toolset for neural networks that complements existing quantitative techniques for data-intensive exploration.","We describe the R package rmcfs that implements an algorithm for ranking features from high dimensional data according to their importance for a given supervised classification task. The ranking is performed prior to addressing the classification task per se. This R package is the new and extended version of the MCFS (Monte Carlo feature selection) algorithm where an early version was published in 2005. The package provides an easy R interface, a set of tools to review results and the new ID (interdependency discovery) component. The algorithm can be used on continuous and/or categorical features (e.g., gene expression and phenotypic data) to produce an objective ranking of features with a statistically well-defined cutoff between informative and non-informative ones. Moreover, the directed ID graph that presents interdependencies between informative features is provided.","Data driven machine learning for predictive modeling problems (classification, regression, or survival analysis) typically involves a number of steps beginning with data preprocessing and ending with performance evaluation. A large number of packages providing tools for the individual steps are available for R, but there is a lack of tools for facilitating rigorous performance evaluation of the complete procedures assembled from them by means of cross-validation, bootstrap, or similar methods. Such a tool should strictly prevent test set observations from influencing model training and meta-parameter tuning, so-called information leakage, in order to not produce overly optimistic performance estimates. Here we present a new package for R denoted emil (evaluation of modeling without information leakage) that offers this form of performance evaluation. It provides a transparent and highly customizable framework for facilitating the assembly, execution, performance evaluation, and interpretation of complete procedures for classification, regression, and survival analysis. The components of package emil have been designed to be as modular and general as possible to allow users to combine, replace, and extend them if needed. Package emil was also developed with scalability in mind and has a small computational overhead, which is a key requirement for analyzing the very big data sets now available in fields like medicine, physics, and finance. First package emil's functionality and usage is explained. Then three specific application examples are presented to show its potential in terms of parallelization, customization for survival analysis, and development of ensemble models. Finally a brief comparison to similar software is provided.","We introduce the R package ContaminatedMixt, conceived to disseminate the use of mixtures of multivariate contaminated normal distributions as a tool for robust clustering and classification under the common assumption of elliptically contoured groups. Thirteen variants of the model are also implemented to introduce parsimony. The expectationconditional maximization algorithm is adopted to obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates, and likelihood-based model selection criteria are used to select the model and the number of groups. Parallel computation can be used on multicore PCs and computer clusters, when several models have to be fitted. Differently from the more popular mixtures of multivariate normal and t distributions, this approach also allows for automatic detection of mild outliers via the maximum a posteriori probabilities procedure. To exemplify the use of the package, applications to artificial and real data are presented.","The R package frailtySurv for simulating and fitting semi-parametric shared frailty models is introduced. Package frailtySurv implements semi-parametric consistent estimators for a variety of frailty distributions, including gamma, log-normal, inverse Gaussian and power variance function, and provides consistent estimators of the standard errors of the parameters' estimators. The parameters' estimators are asymptotically normally distributed, and therefore statistical inference based on the results of this package, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, can be performed using the normal distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the flexibility and correct implementation of the estimator. Two case studies performed with publicly available datasets demonstrate applicability of the package. In the Diabetic Retinopathy Study, the onset of blindness is clustered by patient, and in a large hard drive failure dataset, failure times are thought to be clustered by the hard drive manufacturer and model.","This paper presents two novel statistical analyses of multiblock data using the R language. It is designed for data organized in (K + 1) blocks (i.e., tables) consisting of a block of response variables to be explained by a large number of explanatory variables which are divided into K meaningful blocks. All the variables  -  explanatory and dependent  -  are measured on the same individuals. Two multiblock methods both useful in practice are included, namely multiblock partial least squares regression and multiblock principal component analysis with instrumental variables. The proposed new methods are included within the ade4 package widely used thanks to its great variety of multivariate methods. These methods are available on the one hand for statisticians and on the other hand for users from various fields in the sense that all the values derived from the multiblock processing are available. Some relevant interpretation tools are also developed. Finally the main results are summarized using overall graphical displays. This paper is organized following the different steps of a standard multiblock process, each corresponding to specific R functions. All these steps are illustrated by the analysis of real epidemiological datasets.","In many applications such as transaction data analysis, the classification of long chains of sequences is required. For example, brand purchase history in customer transaction data is in a form like AABCABAA, where A, B, and C are brands of a consumer product. The decision tree-based package mbonsai is designed to handle sequence data of varying lengths using one or multiple variables of interest as predictor variables. This software package uses tree growing and pruning strategies adopted from C4.5 and CART algorithms, and includes new features for handling sequence data and indexing for classification purpose. The software uses a simple command line program for learning and predicting processes, and has the ability to generate user-friendly graphics depicting decision trees. The underlying C++ codes are designed to efficiently process large data sets in ASCII files. Two examples from transaction data sets are used to illustrate the application of mbonsai.","This paper provides an overview of the R package gets, which contains facilities for automated general-to-specific (GETS) modeling of the mean and variance of a regression, and indicator saturation (IS) methods for the detection and modeling of outliers and structural breaks. The mean can be specified as an autoregressive model with covariates (an \"AR-X\" model), and the variance can be specified as an autoregressive log-variance model with covariates (a \"log-ARCH-X\" model). The covariates in the two specifications need not be the same, and the classical linear regression model is obtained as a special case when there is no dynamics, and when there are no covariates in the variance equation. The four main functions of the package are arx, getsm, getsv and isat. The first function estimates an AR-X model with log-ARCH-X errors. The second function undertakes GETS modeling of the mean specification of an 'arx' object. The third function undertakes GETS modeling of the log-variance specification of an 'arx' object. The fourth function undertakes GETS modeling of an indicator-saturated mean specification allowing for the detection of outliers and structural breaks. The usage of two convenience functions for export of results to EViews and Stata are illustrated, and LATEX code of the estimation output can readily be generated.","The R software package excursions contains methods for calculating probabilistic excursion sets, contour credible regions, and simultaneous confidence bands for latent Gaussian stochastic processes and fields. It also contains methods for uncertainty quantification of contour maps and computation of Gaussian integrals. This article describes the theoretical and computational methods used in the package. The main functions of the package are introduced and two examples illustrate how the package can be used.","Cluster-weighted models (CWMs) are mixtures of regression models with random covariates. However, besides having recently become rather popular in statistics and data mining, there is still a lack of support for CWMs within the most popular statistical suites. In this paper, we introduce flexCWM, an R package specifically conceived for fitting CWMs. The package supports modeling the conditioned response variable by means of the most common distributions of the exponential family and by the t distribution. Covariates are allowed to be of mixed-type and parsimonious modeling of multivariate normal covariates, based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the component covariance matrices, is supported. Furthermore, either the response or the covariates distributions can be omitted, yielding to mixtures of distributions and mixtures of regression models with fixed covariates, respectively. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters and likelihood-based information criteria are adopted to select the number of groups and/or a parsimonious model. For the component regression coefficients, standard errors and significance tests are also provided. Parallel computation can be used on multicore PCs and computer clusters, when several models have to be fitted. To exemplify the use of the package, applications to artificial and real datasets, included in the package, are presented.","Many types of medical and scientific experiments acquire raw data in the form of images. Various forms of image processing and image analysis are used to transform the raw image data into quantitative measures that are the basis of subsequent statistical analysis. In this article we describe the SimpleITK R package. SimpleITK is a simplified interface to the insight segmentation and registration toolkit (ITK). ITK is an open source C++ toolkit that has been actively developed over the past 18 years and is widely used by the medical image analysis community. SimpleITK provides packages for many interpreter environments, including R. Currently, it includes several hundred classes for image analysis including a wide range of image input and output, filtering operations, and higher level components for segmentation and registration. Using SimpleITK, development of complex combinations of image and statistical analysis procedures is feasible. This article includes several examples of computational image analysis tasks implemented using SimpleITK, including spherical marker localization, multi-modal image registration, segmentation evaluation, and cell image analysis.","In probabilistic (Bayesian) inferences, we typically want to compute properties of the posterior distribution, describing knowledge of unknown quantities in the context of a particular dataset and the assumed prior information. The marginal likelihood, also known as the \"evidence\", is a key quantity in Bayesian model selection. The diffusive nested sampling algorithm, a variant of nested sampling, is a powerful tool for generating posterior samples and estimating marginal likelihoods. It is effective at solving complex problems including many where the posterior distribution is multimodal or has strong dependencies between variables. DNest4 is an open source (MIT licensed), multi-threaded implementation of this algorithm in C++11, along with associated utilities including: (i) 'RJObject', a class template for finite mixture models; and (ii) a Python package allowing basic use without C++ coding. In this paper we demonstrate DNest4 usage through examples including simple Bayesian data analysis, finite mixture models, and approximate Bayesian computation.","Relative risk regression using a log-link binomial generalized linear model (GLM) is an important tool for the analysis of binary outcomes. However, Fisher scoring, which is the standard method for fitting GLMs in statistical software, may have difficulties in converging to the maximum likelihood estimate due to implicit parameter constraints. logbin is an R package that implements several algorithms for fitting relative risk regression models, allowing stable maximum likelihood estimation while ensuring the required parameter constraints are obeyed. We describe the logbin package and examine its stability and speed for different computational algorithms. We also describe how the package may be used to include flexible semi-parametric terms in relative risk regression models.","In this paper we present the R package bamdit. The name of the package stands for \"Bayesian meta-analysis of diagnostic test data\". bamdit was developed with the aim of simplifying the use of models in meta-analysis, that up to now have demanded great statistical expertise in Bayesian meta-analysis. The package implements a series of innovative statistical techniques including: the Bayesian summary receiver operating characteristic curve, the use of prior distributions that avoid boundary estimation problems of variances and correlations of random effects, analysis of conflict of evidence and robust estimation of model parameters. In addition, the package comes with several published examples of meta-analysis that can be used for illustration or further research in this area.","A multiple-objective optimal design is useful for dose-response studies because it can incorporate several objectives at the design stage. Objectives can be of varying interests and a properly constructed multiple-objective optimal design can provide user-specified efficiencies, delivering higher efficiencies for the more important objectives. In this work, we introduce the VNM package written in R for finding 3-objective locally optimal designs for the 4-parameter logistic (4PL) model widely used in education, bioscience and in the manufacturing industry. The package implements the methodology to construct multipleobjective optimal designs in Hyun and Wong (2015). As illustrative examples, we focus on a biomedical application where our objectives are to estimate: (1) the shape of the dose-response curve, (2) the median effective dose level (ED50) and (3) the minimum effective dose level (MED) in the 4PL model. Our VNM package uses a state-of-theart algorithm to generate multiple-objective optimal designs that meet the user-specified efficiency requirement for each objective, provides tools for calculating the efficiency of the generated design under each objective and also a plot for confirming optimality of the VNM-generated design. The package can also be used to determine an optimal scheme for allocating subjects to the various doses when the number and doses of the drug are fixed in advance.","The analysis of binary three-way data (i.e., persons who indicate which attributes apply to each of a set of objects) may be of interest in several substantive domains as sensory profiling, marketing research or personality assessment. Latent class probabilistic latent feature models (LCPLFMs) may be used to explain binary object-attribute associations on the basis of a small number of binary latent variables (called latent features). As LCPLFMs aim to model object-attribute associations using a small number of latent features they may be more suited to analyze data with many objects/attributes than standard multilevel latent class models which do not include such a dimension reduction. In this paper we describe new functions of the plfm package for analyzing binary three-way data with LCPLFMs. The new functions provide a flexible modeling approach as they allow to (1) specify different assumptions for modeling statistical dependencies between object-attribute pairs, (2) use different assumptions for modeling parameter heterogeneity across persons, (3) conduct a confirmatory analysis by constraining specific parameters to pre-specified values, (4) inspect results with print, summary and plot methods. As an illustration, the models are applied to analyze data on the perception of midsize cars, and to study the situational determinants of anger-related behavior.","We provide several examples of Bayesian semiparametric regression analysis via the Infer.NET package for approximate deterministic inference in Bayesian models. The examples are chosen to encompass a wide range of semiparametric regression situations. Infer.NET is shown to produce accurate inference in comparison with Markov chain Monte Carlo via the BUGS package, but to be considerably faster. Potentially, this contribution represents the start of a new era for semiparametric regression, where large and complex analyses are performed via fast Bayesian inference methodology and software, mainly being developed within Machine Learning.","A currently very active field of research is how to incorporate structure and prior knowledge in machine learning methods. It has lead to numerous developments in the field of non-smooth convex minimization. With recently developed methods it is possible to perform an analysis in which the computed model can be linked to a given structure of the data and simultaneously do variable selection to find a few important features in the data. However, there is still no way to unambiguously simulate data to test proposed algorithms, since the exact solutions to such problems are unknown. The main aim of this paper is to present a theoretical framework for generating simulated data. These simulated data are appropriate when comparing optimization algorithms in the context of linear regression problems with sparse and structured penalties. Additionally, this approach allows the user to control the signal-to-noise ratio, the correlation structure of the data and the optimization problem to which they are the solution. The traditional approach is to simulate random data without taking into account the actual model that will be fit to the data. But when using such an approach it is not possible to know the exact solution of the underlying optimization problem. With our contribution, it is possible to know the exact theoretical solution of a penalized linear regression problem, and it is thus possible to compare algorithms without the need to use, e.g., cross-validation. We also present our implementation, the Python package pylearn-simulate, available at https://github.com/neurospin/pylearn-simulate and released under the BSD 3clause license. We describe the package and give examples at the end of the paper.","We develop a SAS macro and equivalent Stata programs that provide marginalized inference for semi-continuous data using a maximum likelihood approach. These software extensions are based on recently developed methods for marginalized two-part (MTP) models. Both the SAS and Stata extensions can fit simple MTP models for cross-sectional semi-continuous data. In addition, the SAS macro can fit random intercept models for longitudinal or clustered data, whereas the Stata programs can fit MTP models that account for subject level heteroscedasticity and for a complex survey design. Differences and similarities between the two software extensions are highlighted to provide a comparative picture of the available options for estimation, inclusion of random effects, convergence diagnosis, and graphical display. We provide detailed programming syntax, simulated and real data examples to facilitate the implementation of the MTP models for both SAS and Stata software users.","SSpace is a MATLAB toolbox for state space modeling. State space modeling is in itself a powerful and flexible framework for dynamic system modeling, and SSpace is conceived in a way that tries to maximize this flexibility. One of the most salient features is that users implement their models by coding a MATLAB function. In this way, users have complete flexibility when specifying the systems, have absolute control on parameterizations, constraints among parameters, etc. Besides, the toolbox allows for some ways to implement either non-standard models or standard models with non-standard extensions, like heteroskedasticity, time-varying parameters, arbitrary nonlinear relations with inputs, transfer functions without the need of using explicitly the state space form, etc. The toolbox may be used on the basis of scratch state space systems, but is supplied with a number of templates for standard widespread models. A full help system and documentation are provided. The way the toolbox is built allows for extensions in many ways. In order to fuel such extensions and discussions an online forum has been launched.","Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are popular tools for grouping and visualizing data in many areas of science. This paper describes recent changes in package kohonen, implementing several different forms of SOMs. These changes are primarily focused on making the package more useable for large data sets. Memory consumption has decreased dramatically, amongst others, by replacing the old interface to the underlying compiled code by a new one relying on Rcpp. The batch SOM algorithm for training has been added in both sequential and parallel forms. A final important extension of the package's repertoire is the possibility to define and use data-dependent distance functions, extremely useful in cases where standard distances like the Euclidean distance are not appropriate. Several examples of possible applications are presented.","Computing complex statistics on large amounts of data is no longer a corner case, but a daily challenge. However, current tools such as GNU R were not built to efficiently handle large data sets. We propose to vastly improve the execution of R scripts by interpreting them as a declaration of intent rather than an imperative order set in stone. This allows us to apply optimization techniques from the columnar data management research field. We have implemented several of these optimizers in Renjin, an open-source execution environment for R scripts targeted at the Java virtual machine. The demonstration of our approach using a series of micro-benchmarks and experiments on complex survey analysis show orders-of-magnitude improvements in analysis cost.","rTensor is an R package designed to provide a common set of operations and decompositions for multidimensional arrays (tensors). We provide an S4 class that wraps around the base 'array' class and overloads familiar operations to users of 'array', and we provide additional functionality for tensor operations that are becoming more relevant in recent literature. We also provide a general unfolding operation, for which the k-mode unfolding and the matrix vectorization are special cases of. Finally, package rTensor implements common tensor decompositions such as canonical polyadic decomposition, Tucker decomposition, multilinear principal component analysis, t-singular value decomposition, as well as related matrix-based algorithms such as generalized low rank approximation of matrices and popular value decomposition.","Predictor effect displays, introduced in this article, visualize the response surface of complex regression models by averaging and conditioning, producing a sequence of 2D line graphs, one graph or set of graphs for each predictor in the regression problem. Partial residual plots visualize lack of fit, traditionally in relatively simple additive regression models. We combine partial residuals with effect displays to visualize both fit and lack of fit simultaneously in complex regression models, plotting residuals from a model around 2D slices of the fitted response surface. Employing fundamental results on partial residual plots along with examples for both real and contrived data, we discuss and illustrate both the strengths and limitations of the resulting graphs. The methods described in this paper are implemented in the effects package for R.","Relative survival methods are crucial with data in which the cause of death information is either not given or inaccurate, but cause-specific information is nevertheless required. This methodology is standard in cancer registry data analysis and can also be found in other areas. The idea of relative survival is to join the observed data with the general mortality population data and thus extract the information on the disease-specific hazard. While this idea is clear and easy to understand, the practical implementation of the estimators is rather complex since the population hazard for each individual depends on demographic variables and changes in time. A considerable advance in the methodology of this field has been observed in the past decade and while some methods represent only a modification of existing estimators, others require newly programmed functions. The package relsurv covers all the steps of the analysis, from importing the general population tables to estimating and plotting the results. The syntax mimics closely that of the classical survival packages like survival and cmprsk, thus enabling the users to directly use its functions without any further familiarization. In this paper we focus on the nonparametric relative survival analysis, and in particular, on the two key estimators for net survival and crude probability of death. Both estimators were first presented in our package and are still missing in many other software packages, a fact which greatly hampers their frequency of use. The paper offers guidelines for the actual use of the software by means of a detailed nonparametric analysis of the data describing the survival of patients with colon cancer. The data have been provided by the Cancer Registry of Slovenia.","extremefit is a package to estimate the extreme quantiles and probabilities of rare events. The idea of our approach is to adjust the tail of the distribution function over a threshold with a Pareto distribution. We propose a pointwise data driven procedure to choose the threshold. To illustrate the method, we use simulated data sets and three real-world data sets included in the package.","seasonal is a powerful interface between R and X-13ARIMA-SEATS, the seasonal adjustment software developed by the United States Census Bureau. It offers access to almost all features of X-13, including seasonal adjustment via the X-11 and SEATS approaches, automatic ARIMA model search, outlier detection, and support for user-defined holiday variables such as the Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. The required X-13 binaries are provided by the x13binary package, which facilitates a fully-automatic installation on most platforms. A demo website (at http://www.seasonal.website/) supports interactive modeling of custom data. A graphical user interface in the seasonalview package offers the same functionality locally. X-13 can handle monthly, quarterly or bi-annual time series.","This work describes the R package gcKrig for the analysis of geostatistical count data using Gaussian copulas. The package performs likelihood-based inference and spatial prediction using Gaussian copula models with discrete marginals. Two different classes of methods are implemented to evaluate/approximate the likelihood and the predictive distribution. The package implements the computationally intensive tasks in C++ using an R/C++ interface, and has parallel computing capabilities to predict the response at multiple locations simultaneously. In addition, gcKrig also provides functions to simulate and visualize geostatistical count data, and to compute the correlation function of the counts. It is designed to allow a flexible specification of both the marginals and the spatial correlation function. The principal features of the package are illustrated by three data examples from ecology, agronomy and petrology, and a comparison between gcKrig and two other R packages.","This paper introduces JASP, a free graphical software package for basic statistical procedures such as t tests, ANOVAs, linear regression models, and analyses of contingency tables. JASP is open-source and differentiates itself from existing open-source solutions in two ways. First, JASP provides several innovations in user interface design; specifically, results are provided immediately as the user makes changes to options, output is attractive, minimalist, and designed around the principle of progressive disclosure, and analyses can be peer reviewed without requiring a \"syntax\". Second, JASP provides some of the recent developments in Bayesian hypothesis testing and Bayesian parameter estimation. The ease with which these relatively complex Bayesian techniques are available in JASP encourages their broader adoption and furthers a more inclusive statistical reporting practice. The JASP analyses are implemented in R and a series of R packages.","In the early stages of drug development there is often uncertainty about the most promising among a set of different treatments, different doses of the same treatment, or combinations of treatments. Multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) clinical studies provide an efficient solution to determine which intervention is most promising. In this paper we discuss the R package MAMS that allows designing such studies within the group-sequential framework. The package implements MAMS studies with normal, binary, ordinal, or timeto-event endpoints in which either the single best treatment or all promising treatments are continued at the interim analyses. Additionally unexpected design modifications can be accounted for via the use of the conditional error approach. We provide illustrative examples of the use of the package based on real trial designs.","Sequence analysis is being more and more widely used for the analysis of social sequences and other multivariate categorical time series data. However, it is often complex to describe, visualize, and compare large sequence data, especially when there are multiple parallel sequences per subject. Hidden (latent) Markov models (HMMs) are able to detect underlying latent structures and they can be used in various longitudinal settings: to account for measurement error, to detect unobservable states, or to compress information across several types of observations. Extending to mixture hidden Markov models (MHMMs) allows clustering data into homogeneous subsets, with or without external covariates. The seqHMM package in R is designed for the efficient modeling of sequences and other categorical time series data containing one or multiple subjects with one or multiple interdependent sequences using HMMs and MHMMs. Also other restricted variants of the MHMM can be fitted, e.g., latent class models, Markov models, mixture Markov models, or even ordinary multinomial regression models with suitable parameterization of the HMM. Good graphical presentations of data and models are useful during the whole analysis process from the first glimpse at the data to model fitting and presentation of results. The package provides easy options for plotting parallel sequence data, and proposes visualizing HMMs as directed graphs.","The opening of large archives of satellite data such as LANDSAT, MODIS and the SENTINELs has given researchers unprecedented access to data, allowing them to better quantify and understand local and global land change. The need to analyze such large data sets has led to the development of automated and semi-automated methods for satellite image time series analysis. However, few of the proposed methods for remote sensing time series analysis are available as open source software. In this paper we present the R package dtwSat. This package provides an implementation of the time-weighted dynamic time warping method for land cover mapping using sequence of multi-band satellite images. Methods based on dynamic time warping are flexible to handle irregular sampling and out-of-phase time series, and they have achieved significant results in time series analysis. Package dtwSat is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and contributes to making methods for satellite time series analysis available to a larger audience. The package supports the full cycle of land cover classification using image time series, ranging from selecting temporal patterns to visualizing and assessing the results.","This paper presents the R package GAS for the analysis of time series under the generalized autoregressive score (GAS) framework of Creal, Koopman, and Lucas (2013) and Harvey (2013). The distinctive feature of the GAS approach is the use of the score function as the driver of time-variation in the parameters of non-linear models. The GAS package provides functions to simulate univariate and multivariate GAS processes, to estimate the GAS parameters and to make time series forecasts. We illustrate the use of the GAS package with a detailed case study on estimating the time-varying conditional densities of financial asset returns.","The CDF-quantile family of two-parameter distributions with support (0, 1) described in Smithson and Merkle (2014) and recently elaborated by Smithson and Shou (2017), considerably expands the variety of distributions available for modeling random variables on the unit interval. This family is especially useful for modeling quantiles, and also sometimes out-performs the other distributions. The distributions are very tractable, with a location and dispersion parameter, explicit probability distribution functions, cumulative distribution functions, and quantiles. They enable a wide variety of quantile regression models with predictors for the location and dispersion parameters, and simple interpretations of those parameters. The R package cdfquantreg (Shou and Smithson 2019) (at least R 3.2.0) presented in this paper includes 36 distributions from the CDF-quantile family. Separate submodels may be specified for the location and for the dispersion parameters, with different or overlapping sets of predictors in each. The package offers maximum likelihood, Bayesian MCMC, and bootstrap estimation methods. Model diagnostics, including the gradient, three types of residuals, and the dfbeta influence measures, are available for evaluating models. The package also provides pseudo-random generators for all of its distributions. Many of its functions and their usage have forms familiar to R users, and the documentation is extensive. We also present a SAS macro for general linear models using the CDF-quantile family that includes many of the same capabilities as the cdfquantreg package. The paper provides examples of applications to real data-sets.","In paired comparison models, the inclusion of covariates is a tool to account for the heterogeneity of preferences and to investigate which characteristics determine the preferences. Although methods for the selection of variables have been proposed no coherent framework that combines all possible types of covariates is available. There are three different types of covariates that can occur in paired comparisons, the covariates can either vary over the subjects, the objects or both the subjects and the objects of the paired comparisons. This paper gives an overview over all possible types of covariates in paired comparisons and introduces a general framework to include covariate effects into BradleyTerry models. For each type of covariate, appropriate penalty terms that allow for sparser models and, therefore, easier interpretation are proposed. The whole framework is implemented in the R package BTLLasso. The main functionality and the visualization tools of the package are introduced and illustrated by real data sets.","Co-clustering (also known as biclustering), is an important extension of cluster analysis since it allows to simultaneously group objects and features in a matrix, resulting in row and column clusters that are both more accurate and easier to interpret. This paper presents the theory underlying several effective diagonal and non-diagonal co-clustering algorithms, and describes CoClust, a package which provides implementations for these algorithms. The quality of the results produced by the implemented algorithms is demonstrated through extensive tests performed on datasets of various size and balance. CoClust has been designed to complete and easily interface with popular Python machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.","In a wide variety of research fields, dynamic modeling is employed as an instrument to learn and understand complex systems. The differential equations involved in this process are usually non-linear and depend on many parameters whose values determine the characteristics of the emergent system. The inverse problem, i.e., the inference or estimation of parameter values from observed data, is of interest from two points of view. First, the existence point of view, dealing with the question whether the system is able to reproduce the observed dynamics for any parameter values. Second, the identifiability point of view, investigating invariance of the prediction under change of parameter values, as well as the quantification of parameter uncertainty. In this paper, we present the R package dMod providing a framework for dealing with the inverse problem in dynamic systems modeled by ordinary differential equations. The uniqueness of the approach taken by dMod is to provide and propagate accurate derivatives computed from symbolic expressions wherever possible. This derivative information highly supports the convergence of optimization routines and enhances their numerical stability, a requirement for the applicability of sophisticated uncertainty analysis methods. Computational efficiency is achieved by automatic generation and execution of C code. The framework is object-oriented (S3) and provides a variety of functions to set up ordinary differential equation models, observation functions and parameter transformations for multi-conditional parameter estimation. The key elements of the framework and the methodology implemented in dMod are highlighted by an application on a three-compartment transporter model.","Graphical models provide powerful tools to uncover complicated patterns in multivariate data and are commonly used in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we introduce the R package BDgraph which performs Bayesian structure learning for general undirected graphical models (decomposable and non-decomposable) with continuous, discrete, and mixed variables. The package efficiently implements recent improvements in the Bayesian literature, including that of Mohammadi and Wit (2015) and Dobra and Mohammadi (2018). To speed up computations, the computationally intensive tasks have been implemented in C++ and interfaced with R, and the package has parallel computing capabilities. In addition, the package contains several functions for simulation and visualization, as well as several multivariate datasets taken from the literature and used to describe the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief overview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package. The main part of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we illustrate the package's functionality in both real and artificial examples.","In this paper, we present libDirectional, a MATLAB library for directional statistics and directional estimation. It supports a variety of commonly used distributions on the unit circle, such as the von Mises, wrapped normal, and wrapped Cauchy distributions. Furthermore, various distributions on higher-dimensional manifolds such as the unit hypersphere and the hypertorus are available. Based on these distributions, several recursive filtering algorithms in libDirectional allow estimation on these manifolds. The functionality is implemented in a clear, well-documented, and object-oriented structure that is both easy to use and easy to extend.","Estimating the abundance and spatial distribution of animal and plant populations is essential for conservation and management. We introduce the R package Distance that implements distance sampling methods to estimate abundance. We describe how users can obtain estimates of abundance (and density) using the package as well as documenting the links it provides with other more specialized R packages. We also demonstrate how Distance provides a migration pathway from previous software, thereby allowing us to deliver cutting-edge methods to the users more quickly.","We provide a MATLAB toolbox, BFDA, that implements a Bayesian hierarchical model to smooth multiple functional data samples with the assumptions of the same underlying Gaussian process distribution, a Gaussian process prior for the mean function, and an Inverse-Wishart process prior for the covariance function. This model-based approach can borrow strength from all functional data samples to increase the smoothing accuracy, as well as simultaneously estimate the mean-covariance functions. An option of approximating the Bayesian inference process using cubic B-spline basis functions is integrated in BFDA, which allows for efficiently dealing with high-dimensional functional data. Examples of using BFDA in various scenarios and conducting follow-up functional regression are provided. The advantages of BFDA include: (1) simultaneously smooths multiple functional data samples and estimates the mean-covariance functions in a nonparametric way; (2) flexibly deals with sparse and high-dimensional functional data with stationary and nonstationary covariance functions, and without the requirement of common observation grids; (3) provides accurately smoothed functional data for follow-up analysis.","The cgam package contains routines to fit the generalized additive model where the components may be modeled with shape and smoothness assumptions. The main routine is cgam and nineteen symbolic routines are provided to indicate the relationship between the response and each predictor, which satisfies constraints such as monotonicity, convexity, their combinations, tree, and umbrella orderings. The user may specify constrained splines to fit the individual components for continuous predictors, and various types of orderings for the ordinal predictors. In addition, the user may specify parametrically modeled covariates. Two-way interactions between continuous variables, where the relationship with the response is constrained to be monotone, are modeled with \"warpedplane splines.\" The set over which the likelihood is maximized is a polyhedral convex cone, and a least-squares solution is obtained by projecting the data vector onto the cone. For generalized models, the fit is obtained through iteratively re-weighted cone projections. The cone information criterion (CIC) is provided and may be used to compare fits for combinations of variables and shapes. The graphical routine plotpersp will plot an estimated mean surface for a selected pair of predictors, given an object fitted with cgam. This package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cgam.","The GPareto package for R provides multi-objective optimization algorithms for expensive black-box functions and an ensemble of dedicated uncertainty quantification methods. Popular methods such as efficient global optimization in the mono-objective case rely on Gaussian processes or kriging to build surrogate models. Driven by the prediction uncertainty given by these models, several infill criteria have also been proposed in a multi-objective setup to select new points sequentially and efficiently cope with severely limited evaluation budgets. They are implemented in the package, in addition with Pareto front estimation and uncertainty quantification visualization in the design and objective spaces. Finally, it attempts to fill the gap between expert use of the corresponding methods and user-friendliness, where many efforts have been put on providing graphical postprocessing, standard tuning and interactivity.","Interest in social segregation measurement has increased strongly over the years and the number of segregation indices proposed in the literature have become more complex. However there are only a few software applications that can be employed to analyze social segregation, and these are usually available as a plug-in/package in geographic information system (GIS) software or as limited stand-alone application. Thus, the development of a package which exploits the power and versatility of the R environment for statistical computing and graphics would be desirable. Also, analysis of the segregation indices shows that there are ambiguities and errors in the literature, and consequently in the available software applications. This is an even more important reason why we need to develop a new tool to bring some order to the world of segregation measurement. This paper contributes also by proposing an automatic statistical testing methodology for these indices, using several resampling techniques: randomization tests, bootstrap and jackknife.","Multivariate time series with long-dependence are observed in many applications such as finance, geophysics or neuroscience. Many packages provide estimation tools for univariate settings but few are addressing the problem of long-dependence estimation for multivariate settings. The package multiwave is providing efficient estimation procedures for multivariate time series. Two semi-parametric estimation methods of the long-memory exponents and long-run covariance matrix of time series are implemented. The first one is the Fourier-based estimation proposed by Shimotsu (2007) and the second one is a wavelet-based estimation described in Achard and Gannaz (2016). The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the R package multiwave with its practical application perspectives.","The R package CFC performs cause-specific, competing-risk survival analysis by computing cumulative incidence functions from unadjusted, cause-specific survival functions. A high-level API in CFC enables end-to-end survival and competing-risk analysis, using a single-line function call, based on the parametric survival regression models in the survival package. A low-level API allows users to achieve more flexibility by supplying their custom survival functions, perhaps in a Bayesian setting. Utility methods for summarizing and plotting the output allow population-average cumulative incidence functions to be calculated, visualized and compared to unadjusted survival curves. Numerical and computational optimization strategies are employed for efficient and reliable computation of the coupled integrals involved. To address potential integrable singularities caused by infinite cause-specific hazards, particularly near time-from-index of zero, integrals are transformed to remove their dependency on hazard functions, making them solely functions of causespecific, unadjusted survival functions. This implicit variable transformation also provides for easier extensibility of CFC to handle custom survival models since it only requires the users to implement a maximum of one function per cause. The transformed integrals are numerically calculated using a generalization of Simpson's rule to handle the implicit change of variable from time to survival, while a generalized trapezoidal rule is used as reference for error calculation. An OpenMP-parallelized, efficient C++ implementation  -  using packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo  -  makes the application of CFC in Bayesian settings practical, where a potentially large number of samples represent the posterior distribution of cause-specific survival functions.","Hyperspectral remote sensing is a promising tool for a variety of applications including ecology, geology, analytical chemistry and medical research. This article presents the new hsdar package for R statistical software, which performs a variety of analysis steps taken during a typical hyperspectral remote sensing approach. The package introduces a new class for efficiently storing large hyperspectral data sets such as hyperspectral cubes within R. The package includes several important hyperspectral analysis tools such as continuum removal, normalized ratio indices and integrates two widely used radiation transfer models. In addition, the package provides methods to directly use the functionality of the caret package for machine learning tasks. Two case studies demonstrate the package's range of functionality: First, plant leaf chlorophyll content is estimated and second, cancer in the human larynx is detected from hyperspectral data.","This paper introduces ggenealogy (Rutter, Vanderplas, and Cook 2019), a developing R software package that provides tools for searching through genealogical data, generating basic statistics on their graphical structures using parent and child connections, parsing and performing calculations on branches of interest, and displaying the results. It is possible to draw the genealogy in relation to variables related to the nodes, and to determine and display the shortest path distances between the nodes. Production of pairwise distance matrices and genealogical diagrams constrained on generation are also available in the visualization toolkit. The tools are being tested on a dataset with milestone cultivars of soybean varieties (Hymowitz, Newell, and Carmer 1977) as well as on a web-based database of the academic genealogy of mathematicians (North Dakota State University and American Mathematical Society 2010). The latest stable package version is available in source and binary form on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).","Matrix decompositions are fundamental tools in the area of applied mathematics, statistical computing, and machine learning. In particular, low-rank matrix decompositions are vital, and widely used for data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and data compression. Massive datasets, however, pose a computational challenge for traditional algorithms, placing significant constraints on both memory and processing power. Recently, the powerful concept of randomness has been introduced as a strategy to ease the computational load. The essential idea of probabilistic algorithms is to employ some amount of randomness in order to derive a smaller matrix from a high-dimensional data matrix. The smaller matrix is then used to compute the desired low-rank approximation. Such algorithms are shown to be computationally efficient for approximating matrices with low-rank structure. We present the R package rsvd, and provide a tutorial introduction to randomized matrix decompositions. Specifically, randomized routines for the singular value decomposition, (robust) principal component analysis, interpolative decomposition, and CUR decomposition are discussed. Several examples demonstrate the routines, and show the computational advantage over other methods implemented in R.","Model-based dose escalation designs have gained increasing interest due to the need for more efficient and informative Phase I trials. The wide-spread implementation of such designs has been hindered by the need for either licensing specialized commercial software or programming the design and simulations from scratch for each project. The R package crmPack provides a simple and unified object-oriented framework for model-based dose escalation designs. This enables the standard use of such designs, while being able to flexibly adapt and extend them. The framework comprises classes and methods for the data structure including the dose grid, statistical models including prior specification, rules for maximum increments, next best dose, and adaptive stopping and cohort sizes. In addition to multiple modified classic continual reassessment method and escalation with overdose control designs with possibly advanced prior specifications (e.g., minimal informative and mixture priors), crmPack currently features dual-endpoint (safety and biomarker) designs and two-part designs. Optional assignment of a small number of patients in each cohort to placebo instead of treatment enables the use in trials outside oncology.","The development of simulation-based methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), has contributed to an increased interest in the Bayesian framework as an alternative to deal with factor models. Many studies have used Bayesian factor analysis to explore gene expression data. We are particularly interested in the application of a sparse latent factor model (SLFM) based on sparsity priors (mixtures) to assess the significance of factors. The SLFM measures how strong the observed coherent expression pattern is in the data, which is an important source of information to evaluate gene activity. In the literature, this type of model has shown better results than other approaches intended for identification of patterns and metagene groups related to the underlying biology. However, a full Bayesian factor model relying on MCMC algorithms has an expensive computational cost, which makes it unattractive for general users. In this paper, we present the package slfm which uses C++ implementation via Rcpp to improve the computational performance of the SLFM within the widely used statistical tool R. We investigate real and simulated microarray data related to breast cancer.","In this paper we present the toolbox MultipleCar, which is a general program for computing multiple correspondence analysis and which was designed using a graphical user interface. The procedures implemented in MultipleCar are the usual ones that are already available in other applications, plus some additional procedures. MultipleCar makes it possible to compute (1) joint correspondence analysis, and (2) orthogonal and oblique rotation of coordinates. Although MultipleCar was developed in MATLAB, we compiled it as a standalone application for Windows operative systems based on graphical user interfaces. The users can decide whether to use the advanced MATLAB version of MultipleCar, or the standalone version (which does not require any programming skills).","rankdist is a recently developed R package which implements various distance-based ranking models. These models capture the occurring probability of rankings based on the distances between them. The package provides a framework for fitting and evaluating finite mixture of distance-based models. This paper also presents a new probability model for ranking data based on a new notion of weighted Kendall distance. The new model is flexible and more interpretable than the existing models. We show that the new model has an analytic form of the probability mass function and the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters can be obtained efficiently even for ranking involving a large number of objects.","In the package corr2D two-dimensional correlation analysis is implemented in R. This paper describes how two-dimensional correlation analysis is done in the package and how the mathematical equations are translated into R code. The paper features a simple tutorial with executable code for beginners, insight into the calculations done before the correlation analysis, a detailed look at the parallelization of the fast Fourier transformation based correlation analysis and a speed test of the calculation. The package corr2D offers the possibility to preprocess, correlate and postprocess spectroscopic data using exclusively the R language. Thus, corr2D is a welcome addition to the toolbox of spectroscopists and makes two-dimensional correlation analysis more accessible and transparent.","This article describes the R package BinaryEPPM and its use in determining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of extended Poisson process models for grouped binary data. These provide a Poisson process family of flexible models that can handle unlimited under-dispersion but limited over-dispersion in such data, with the binomial distribution being a special case. Within BinaryEPPM, models with the mean and variance related to covariates are constructed to match a generalized linear model formulation. Combining such under-dispersed models with standard over-dispersed models such as the beta binomial distribution provides a very general form of residual distribution for modeling grouped binary data. Use of the package is illustrated by application to several data-sets.","Data cleaning and validation are important steps in any data analysis, as the validity of the conclusions from the analysis hinges on the quality of the input data. Mistakes in the data can arise for any number of reasons, including erroneous codings, malfunctioning measurement equipment, and inconsistent data generation manuals. Ideally, a human investigator should go through each variable in the dataset and look for potential errors  -  both in input values and codings  -  but that process can be very time-consuming, expensive and error-prone in itself. We describe an R package, dataMaid, which implements an extensive and customizable suite of quality assessment aids that can be applied to a dataset in order to identify potential problems in its variables. The results are presented in an auto-generated, nontechnical, stand-alone overview document intended to be perused by an investigator with an understanding of the variables in the data, but not necessarily knowledge of R. Thereby, dataMaid aids the dialogue between data analysts and field experts, while also providing easy documentation of reproducible data quality screening. Moreover, the dataMaid solution changes the data screening process from the usual ad hoc approach to a systematic, well-documented endeavor. dataMaid also provides a suite of more typical R tools for interactive data quality assessment and screening, where the data inspections are executed directly in the R console.","The simmer package brings discrete-event simulation to R. It is designed as a generic yet powerful process-oriented framework. The architecture encloses a robust and fast simulation core written in C++ with automatic monitoring capabilities. It provides a rich and flexible R API (application programming interface) that revolves around the concept of trajectory, a common path in the simulation model for entities of the same type.","When analyzing correlated time to event data, shared frailty (random effect) models are particularly attractive. However, the estimation of such models has proved challenging. In semiparametric models, this is further complicated by the presence of the nonparametric baseline hazard. Although recent years have seen an increased availability of software for fitting frailty models, most software packages focus either on a small number of distributions of the random effect, or support only on a few data scenarios. frailtyEM is an R package that provides maximum likelihood estimation of semiparametric shared frailty models using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The implementation is consistent across several scenarios, including possibly left truncated clustered failures and recurrent events in both calendar time and gap time formulation. A large number of frailty distributions belonging to the power variance function family are supported. Several methods facilitate access to predicted survival and cumulative hazard curves, both for an individual and on a population level. An extensive number of summary measures and statistical tests are also provided.","The Bayesian spectral analysis model (BSAM) is a powerful tool to deal with semiparametric methods in regression and density estimation based on the spectral representation of Gaussian process priors. The bsamGP package for R provides a comprehensive set of programs for the implementation of fully Bayesian semiparametric methods based on BSAM. Currently, bsamGP includes semiparametric additive models for regression, generalized models and density estimation. In particular, bsamGP deals with constrained regression models with monotone, convex/concave, S-shaped and U-shaped functions by modeling derivatives of regression functions as squared Gaussian processes. bsamGP also contains Bayesian model selection procedures for testing the adequacy of a parametric model relative to a non-specific semiparametric alternative and the existence of the shape restriction. To maximize computational efficiency, we carry out posterior sampling algorithms of all models using compiled Fortran code. The package is illustrated through Bayesian semiparametric analyses of synthetic data and benchmark data.","This paper describes the R package mvLSW. The package contains a suite of tools for the analysis of multivariate locally stationary wavelet (LSW) time series. Key elements include: (i) the simulation of multivariate LSW time series for a given multivariate evolutionary wavelet spectrum (EWS); (ii) estimation of the time-dependent multivariate EWS for a given time series; (iii) estimation of the time-dependent coherence and partial coherence between time series channels; and, (iv) estimation of approximate confidence intervals for multivariate EWS estimates. A demonstration of the package is presented via both a simulated example and a case study with EuStockMarkets from the datasets package.","We describe efficient algorithms and open-source code for the second-order statistical analysis of point events on a linear network. Typical summary statistics are adaptations of Ripley's K-function and the pair correlation function to the case of a linear network, with distance measured by the shortest path in the network. Simple implementations consume substantial time and memory. For an efficient implementation, the data structure representing the network must be economical in its use of memory, but must also enable rapid searches to be made. We have developed such an efficient implementation in C with an R interface written as an extension to the R package spatstat. The algorithms handle realistic large networks, as we demonstrate using a database of all road accidents recorded in Western Australia.","A new alternative to the standard Poisson regression model for count data is suggested. This new family of models is based on discrete distributions derived from renewal processes, i.e., distributions of the number of events by some time t. Unlike the Poisson model, these models have, in general, time-dependent hazard functions. Any survival distribution can be used to describe the inter-arrival times between events, which gives a rich class of count processes with great flexibility for modelling both underdispersed and overdispersed data. The R package Countr provides a function, renewalCount(), for fitting renewal count regression models and methods for working with the fitted models. The interface is designed to mimic the glm() interface and standard methods for model exploration, diagnosis and prediction are implemented. Package Countr implements stateof-the-art recently developed methods for fast computation of the count probabilities. The package functionalities are illustrated using several datasets.","Probabilistic forecasts in the form of probability distributions over future events have become popular in several fields including meteorology, hydrology, economics, and demography. In typical applications, many alternative statistical models and data sources can be used to produce probabilistic forecasts. Hence, evaluating and selecting among competing methods is an important task. The scoringRules package for R provides functionality for comparative evaluation of probabilistic models based on proper scoring rules, covering a wide range of situations in applied work. This paper discusses implementation and usage details, presents case studies from meteorology and economics, and points to the relevant background literature.","The detection of regions with unusually high risk plays an important role in disease mapping and the analysis of public health data. In particular, the detection of groups of areas (i.e., clusters) where the risk is significantly high is often conducted by public health authorities. Many methods have been proposed for the detection of these disease clusters, most of them based on moving windows, such as Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic. Here we describe a model-based approach for the detection of disease clusters implemented in the DClusterm package. Our model-based approach is based on representing a large number of possible clusters by dummy variables and then fitting many generalized linear models to the data where these covariates are included one at a time. Cluster detection is done by performing a variable or model selection among all fitted models using different criteria. Because of our model-based approach, cluster detection can be performed using different types of likelihoods and latent effects. We cover the detection of spatial and spatiotemporal clusters, as well as how to account for covariates, zero-inflated datasets and overdispersion in the data.","This paper demonstrates how to use the R package stm for structural topic modeling. The structural topic model allows researchers to flexibly estimate a topic model that includes document-level metadata. Estimation is accomplished through a fast variational approximation. The stm package provides many useful features, including rich ways to explore topics, estimate uncertainty, and visualize quantities of interest.","In this paper we introduce fuzzy forests, a novel machine learning algorithm for ranking the importance of features in high-dimensional classification and regression problems. Fuzzy forests is specifically designed to provide relatively unbiased rankings of variable importance in the presence of highly correlated features, especially when the number of features, p, is much larger than the sample size, n (p  n). We introduce our implementation of fuzzy forests in the R package, fuzzyforest. Fuzzy forests works by taking advantage of the network structure between features. First, the features are partitioned into separate modules such that the correlation within modules is high and the correlation between modules is low. The package fuzzyforest allows for easy use of the package WGCNA (weighted gene coexpression network analysis, alternatively known as weighted correlation network analysis) to form modules of features such that the modules are roughly uncorrelated. Then recursive feature elimination random forests (RFE-RFs) are used on each module, separately. From the surviving features, a final group is selected and ranked using one last round of RFE-RFs. This procedure results in a ranked variable importance list whose size is pre-specified by the user. The selected features can then be used to construct a predictive model.","We present the R package clustrd which implements a class of methods that combine dimension reduction and clustering of continuous or categorical data. In particular, for continuous data, the package contains implementations of factorial K-means and reduced K-means; both methods combine principal component analysis with K-means clustering. For categorical data, the package provides MCA K-means, i-FCB and cluster correspondence analysis, which combine multiple correspondence analysis with K-means. Two examples on real data sets are provided to illustrate the usage of the main functions.","The effects of response bias in psychological tests have been investigated for years, the two most common being social desirability (SD) and acquiescence (AC). However, the traditional methods for controlling or eliminating the impact of those biases in participants' scores have several limitations. Some factor analysis-based methods can overcome some of these limitations, such as the procedure proposed by Ferrando, Lorenzo-Seva, and Chico (2009). Nevertheless, this method involves programming skills that are not common among applied researchers or clinicians. Consequently, we have developed a stand-alone, user-friendly application that provides an easy way of using the aforementioned method to perform a factor analysis which controls for the effect of AC and SD. The program has been developed in the MATLAB environment and its distribution is entirely free.","This article describes the implementation and use of the R package dbscan, which provides complete and fast implementations of the popular density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN and the augmented ordering algorithm OPTICS. Package dbscan uses advanced open-source spatial indexing data structures implemented in C++ to speed up computation. An important advantage of this implementation is that it is up-to-date with several improvements that have been added since the original algorithms were publications (e.g., artifact corrections and dendrogram extraction methods for OPTICS). We provide a consistent presentation of the DBSCAN and OPTICS algorithms, and compare dbscan's implementation with other popular libraries such as the R package fpc, ELKI, WEKA, PyClustering, SciKit-Learn, and SPMF in terms of available features and using an experimental comparison.","The R package emdi enables the estimation of regionally disaggregated indicators using small area estimation methods and includes tools for processing, assessing, and presenting the results. The mean of the target variable, the quantiles of its distribution, the headcount ratio, the poverty gap, the Gini coefficient, the quintile share ratio, and customized indicators are estimated using direct and model-based estimation with the empirical best predictor (Molina and Rao 2010). The user is assisted by automatic estimation of datadriven transformation parameters. Parametric and semi-parametric, wild bootstrap for mean squared error estimation are implemented with the latter offering protection against possible misspecification of the error distribution. Tools for (a) customized parallel computing, (b) model diagnostic analyses, (c) creating high quality maps and (d) exporting the results to Excel and OpenDocument Spreadsheets are included. The functionality of the package is illustrated with example data sets for estimating the Gini coefficient and median income for districts in Austria.","Nonparametric kernel density and local polynomial regression estimators are very popular in statistics, economics, and many other disciplines. They are routinely employed in applied work, either as part of the main empirical analysis or as a preliminary ingredient entering some other estimation or inference procedure. This article describes the main methodological and numerical features of the software package nprobust, which offers an array of estimation and inference procedures for nonparametric kernel-based density and local polynomial regression methods, implemented in both the R and Stata statistical platforms. The package includes not only classical bandwidth selection, estimation, and inference methods (Wand and Jones 1995; Fan and Gijbels 1996), but also other recent developments in the statistics and econometrics literatures such as robust bias-corrected inference and coverage error optimal bandwidth selection (Calonico, Cattaneo, and Farrell 2018, 2019a). Furthermore, this article also proposes a simple way of estimating optimal bandwidths in practice that always delivers the optimal mean square error convergence rate regardless of the specific evaluation point, that is, no matter whether it is implemented at a boundary or interior point. Numerical performance is illustrated using an empirical application and simulated data, where a detailed numerical comparison with other R packages is given.","This paper introduces the R package sgmcmc; which can be used for Bayesian inference on problems with large data sets using stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC). Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as Metropolis-Hastings, are known to run prohibitively slowly as the data set size increases. SGMCMC solves this issue by only using a subset of data at each iteration. SGMCMC requires calculating gradients of the log-likelihood and log-priors, which can be time consuming and error prone to perform by hand. The sgmcmc package calculates these gradients itself using automatic differentiation, making the implementation of these methods much easier. To do this, the package uses the software library TensorFlow, which has a variety of statistical distributions and mathematical operations as standard, meaning a wide class of models can be built using this framework. SGMCMC has become widely adopted in the machine learning literature, but less so in the statistics community. We believe this may be partly due to lack of software; this package aims to bridge this gap.","We describe the package MSGARCH, which implements Markov-switching GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity) models in R with efficient C++ object-oriented programming. Markov-switching GARCH models have become popular methods to account for regime changes in the conditional variance dynamics of time series. The package MSGARCH allows the user to perform simulations as well as maximum likelihood and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimations of a very large class of Markov-switching GARCH-type models. The package also provides methods to make single-step and multi-step ahead forecasts of the complete conditional density of the variable of interest. Risk management tools to estimate conditional volatility, value-at-risk, and expected-shortfall are also available. We illustrate the broad functionality of the MSGARCH package using exchange rate and stock market return data.","Learning graphical models from data is an important problem with wide applications, ranging from genomics to the social sciences. Nowadays datasets often have upwards of thousands  -  sometimes tens or hundreds of thousands  -  of variables and far fewer samples. To meet this challenge, we have developed a new R package called sparsebn for learning the structure of large, sparse graphical models with a focus on Bayesian networks. While there are many existing software packages for this task, this package focuses on the unique setting of learning large networks from high-dimensional data, possibly with interventions. As such, the methods provided place a premium on scalability and consistency in a high-dimensional setting. Furthermore, in the presence of interventions, the methods implemented here achieve the goal of learning a causal network from data. Additionally, the sparsebn package is fully compatible with existing software packages for network analysis.","We present the R package SimInf which provides an efficient and very flexible framework to conduct data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large scale disease spread simulations. The framework integrates infection dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov chains using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and incorporates available data such as births, deaths and movements as scheduled events at predefined time-points. Using C code for the numerical solvers and divide work over multiple processors ensures high performance when simulating a sample outcome. One of our design goals was to make SimInf extendable and enable usage of the numerical solvers from other R extension packages in order to facilitate complex epidemiological research. In this paper, we provide a technical description of the framework and demonstrate its use on some basic examples. We also discuss how to specify and extend the framework with user-defined models.","Many real-world systems are profitably described as complex networks that grow over time. Preferential attachment and node fitness are two simple growth mechanisms that not only explain certain structural properties commonly observed in real-world systems, but are also tied to a number of applications in modeling and inference. While there are statistical packages for estimating various parametric forms of the preferential attachment function, there is no such package implementing non-parametric estimation procedures. The non-parametric approach to the estimation of the preferential attachment function allows for comparatively finer-grained investigations of the \"rich-get-richer\" phenomenon that could lead to novel insights in the search to explain certain nonstandard structural properties observed in real-world networks. This paper introduces the R package PAFit, which implements non-parametric procedures for estimating the preferential attachment function and node fitnesses in a growing network, as well as a number of functions for generating complex networks from these two mechanisms. The main computational part of the package is implemented in C++ with OpenMP to ensure scalability to large-scale networks. In this paper, we first introduce the main functionalities of PAFit through simulated examples, and then use the package to analyze a collaboration network between scientists in the field of complex networks. The results indicate the joint presence of \"richget-richer\" and \"fit-get-richer\" phenomena in the collaboration network. The estimated attachment function is observed to be near-linear, which we interpret as meaning that the chance an author gets a new collaborator is proportional to their current number of collaborators. Furthermore, the estimated author fitnesses reveal a host of familiar faces from the complex networks community among the field's topmost fittest network scientists.","The mlt package implements maximum likelihood estimation in the class of conditional transformation models. Based on a suitable explicit parameterization of the unconditional or conditional transformation function using infrastructure from package basefun, we show how one can define, estimate, and compare a cascade of increasingly complex transformation models in the maximum likelihood framework. Models for the unconditional or conditional distribution function of any univariate response variable are set-up and estimated in the same computational framework simply by choosing an appropriate transformation function and parameterization thereof. As it is computationally cheap to evaluate the distribution function, models can be estimated by maximization of the exact likelihood, especially in the presence of random censoring or truncation. The relatively dense high-level implementation in the R system for statistical computing allows generalization of many established implementations of linear transformation models, such as the Cox model or other parametric models for the analysis of survival or ordered categorical data, to the more complex situations illustrated in this paper.","The rscala software is a simple, two-way bridge between R and Scala that allows users to leverage the unique strengths of both languages in a single project. Scala classes can be instantiated from R and Scala methods can be called. Arbitrary Scala code can be executed on-the-fly from within R and callbacks to R are supported. R packages can be developed based on Scala. Conversely, rscala also enables R code to be embedded within a Scala application. The rscala package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and has no dependencies beyond base R and the Scala standard library.","M-estimation, or estimating equation, methods are widely applicable for point estimation and asymptotic inference. In this paper, we present an R package that can find roots and compute the empirical sandwich variance estimator for any set of user-specified, unbiased estimating equations. Examples from the M-estimation primer by Stefanski and Boos (2002) demonstrate use of the software. The package also includes a framework for finite sample, heteroscedastic, and autocorrelation variance corrections, and a website with an extensive collection of tutorials.","The Oja median is one of several extensions of the univariate median to the multivariate case. It has many desirable properties, but is computationally demanding. In this paper, we first review the properties of the Oja median and compare it to other multivariate medians. Then, we discuss four algorithms to compute the Oja median, which are implemented in our R package OjaNP. Besides these algorithms, the package contains also functions to compute Oja signs, Oja signed ranks, Oja ranks, and the related scatter concepts. To illustrate their use, the corresponding multivariate one- and C-sample location tests are implemented.","We discuss the R package SQUAREM for accelerating iterative algorithms which exhibit slow, monotone convergence. These include the well-known expectation-maximization algorithm, majorize-minimize (MM), and other EM-like algorithms such as expectation conditional maximization, and generalized EM algorithms. We demonstrate the simplicity, generality, and power of SQUAREM through a wide array of applications of EM/MM problems, including binary Poisson mixture, factor analysis, interval censoring, genetics admixture, and logistic regression maximum likelihood estimation (an MM problem). We show that SQUAREM is easy to apply, and can accelerate any fixed-point, smooth, contraction mapping with linear convergence rate. The squared iterative scheme (SQUAREM) algorithm provides significant speed-up of EM-like algorithms. The margin of the advantage for SQUAREM is especially huge for high-dimensional problems or when the EM step is relatively time-consuming to evaluate. SQUAREM can be used off-the-shelf since there is no need for the user to tweak any control parameters to optimize performance. Given its remarkable ease of use, SQUAREM may be considered as a default accelerator for slowly converging EM-like algorithms. All the comparisons of CPU computing time in the paper are made on a quad-core 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 Mac computer. R package SQUAREM is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SQUAREM/.","Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D) represent a widely used class of population-based metaheuristics for the solution of multicriteria optimization problems. We introduce the MOEADr package, which offers many of these variants as instantiations of a component-oriented framework. This approach contributes for easier reproducibility of existing MOEA/D variants from the literature, as well as for faster development and testing of new composite algorithms. The package offers an standardized, modular implementation of MOEA/D based on this framework, which was designed aiming at providing researchers and practitioners with a standard way to discuss and express MOEA/D variants. In this paper we introduce the design principles behind the MOEADr package, as well as its current components. Three case studies are provided to illustrate the main aspects of the package.","Spatial survival analysis has received a great deal of attention over the last 20 years due to the important role that geographical information can play in predicting survival. This paper provides an introduction to a set of programs for implementing some Bayesian spatial survival models in R using the package spBayesSurv. The function survregbayes includes the three most commonly-used semiparametric models: proportional hazards, proportional odds, and accelerated failure time. All manner of censored survival times are simultaneously accommodated including uncensored, interval censored, current-status, left and right censored, and mixtures of these. Left-truncated data are also accommodated. Time-dependent covariates are allowed under the piecewise constant assumption. Both georeferenced and areally observed spatial locations are handled via frailties. Model fit is assessed with conditional Cox-Snell residual plots, and model choice is carried out via the log pseudo marginal likelihood, the deviance information criterion and the WatanabeAkaike information criterion. The accelerated failure time frailty model with a covariatedependent baseline is included in the function frailtyGAFT. In addition, the package also provides two marginal survival models: proportional hazards and linear dependent Dirichlet process mixtures, where the spatial dependence is modeled via spatial copulas. Note that the package can also handle non-spatial data using non-spatial versions of the aforementioned models.","Statistical procedures such as Bayes factor model selection and Bayesian model averaging require the computation of normalizing constants (e.g., marginal likelihoods). These normalizing constants are notoriously difficult to obtain, as they usually involve highdimensional integrals that cannot be solved analytically. Here we introduce an R package that uses bridge sampling (Meng and Wong 1996; Meng and Schilling 2002) to estimate normalizing constants in a generic and easy-to-use fashion. For models implemented in Stan, the estimation procedure is automatic. We illustrate the functionality of the package with three examples.","multiplex is a computer program that provides algebraic tools for the analysis of multiple network structures within the R environment. Apart from the possibility to create and manipulate multivariate data representing multiplex, signed, and two-mode networks, this package offers a collection of functions that deal with algebraic systems  -  such as the partially ordered semigroup, and balance or cluster semirings  -  their decomposition, and the enumeration of bundle patterns occurring at different levels of the network. Moreover, through Galois derivations between families of the pairs of subsets in different domains it is possible to analyze affiliation networks with an algebraic approach. Visualization of multigraphs, different forms of bipartite graphs, inclusion lattices, Cayley graphs is supported as well with related packages.","BPEC is an R package for Bayesian phylogeographic and ecological clustering which allows geographical, environmental and phenotypic measurements to be combined with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences in order to reveal geographic structuring of DNA sequence clusters consistent with migration events. DNA sequences are modelled using a collapsed version of a simplified coalescent model projected onto haplotype trees, which subsequently give rise to constrained clusterings as migrations occur. Within each cluster, a multivariate Gaussian distribution of the covariates (geographical, environmental, phenotypic) is used. Inference follows tailored reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling so that the number of clusters (i.e., migrations) does not need to be pre-specified. A number of output plots and visualizations are provided which reflect the posterior distribution of the parameters of interest. BPEC also includes functions that create output files which can be loaded into Google Earth. The package commands are illustrated through an example dataset of the polytypic Near Eastern brown frog Rana macrocnemis analyzed using BPEC.","Prediction rule ensembles (PREs) are sparse collections of rules, offering highly interpretable regression and classification models. This paper shows how they can be fitted using function pre from R package pre, which derives PREs largely through the methodology of Friedman and Popescu (2008). The implementation and functionality of pre is described and illustrated through application on a dataset on the prediction of depression. Furthermore, accuracy and sparsity of pre is compared with that of single trees, random forests, lasso regression and the original RuleFit implementation of Friedman and Popescu (2008) in four benchmark datasets. Results indicate that pre derives ensembles with predictive accuracy similar to that of random forests, while using a smaller number of variables for prediction. Furthermore, pre provided better accuracy and sparsity than the original RuleFit implementation.","This paper is devoted to the R package JSM which performs joint statistical modeling of survival and longitudinal data. In biomedical studies it has been increasingly common to collect both baseline and longitudinal covariates along with a possibly censored survival time. Instead of analyzing the survival and longitudinal outcomes separately, joint modeling approaches have attracted substantive attention in the recent literature and have been shown to correct biases from separate modeling approaches and enhance information. Most existing approaches adopt a linear mixed effects model for the longitudinal component and the Cox proportional hazards model for the survival component. We extend the Cox model to a more general class of transformation models for the survival process, where the baseline hazard function is completely unspecified leading to semiparametric survival models. We also offer a non-parametric multiplicative random effects model for the longitudinal process in JSM in addition to the linear mixed effects model. In this paper, we present the joint modeling framework that is implemented in JSM, as well as the standard error estimation methods, and illustrate the package with two real data examples: a liver cirrhosis data and a Mayo Clinic primary biliary cirrhosis data.","Manifold optimization appears in a wide variety of computational problems in the applied sciences. In recent statistical methodologies such as sufficient dimension reduction and regression envelopes, estimation relies on the optimization of likelihood functions over spaces of matrices such as the Stiefel or Grassmann manifolds. Recently, Huang, Absil, Gallivan, and Hand (2016) have introduced the library ROPTLIB, which provides a framework and state of the art algorithms to optimize real-valued objective functions over commonly used matrix-valued Riemannian manifolds. This article presents ManifoldOptim, an R package that wraps the C++ library ROPTLIB. ManifoldOptim enables users to access functionality in ROPTLIB through R so that optimization problems can easily be constructed, solved, and integrated into larger R codes. Computationally intensive problems can be programmed with Rcpp and RcppArmadillo, and otherwise accessed through R. We illustrate the practical use of ManifoldOptim through several motivating examples involving dimension reduction and envelope methods in regression.","The R package mvord implements composite likelihood estimation in the class of multivariate ordinal regression models with a multivariate probit and a multivariate logit link. A flexible modeling framework for multiple ordinal measurements on the same subject is set up, which takes into consideration the dependence among the multiple observations by employing different error structures. Heterogeneity in the error structure across the subjects can be accounted for by the package, which allows for covariate dependent error structures. In addition, different regression coefficients and threshold parameters for each response are supported. If a reduction of the parameter space is desired, constraints on the threshold as well as on the regression coefficients can be specified by the user. The proposed multivariate framework is illustrated by means of a credit risk application.","We present the R package mgm for the estimation of k-order mixed graphical models (MGMs) and mixed vector autoregressive (mVAR) models in high-dimensional data. These are a useful extensions of graphical models for only one variable type, since data sets consisting of mixed types of variables (continuous, count, categorical) are ubiquitous. In addition, we allow to relax the stationarity assumption of both models by introducing time-varying versions of MGMs and mVAR models based on a kernel weighting approach. Time-varying models offer a rich description of temporally evolving systems and allow to identify external influences on the model structure such as the impact of interventions. We provide the background of all implemented methods and provide fully reproducible examples that illustrate how to use the package.","This paper introduces the funData R package as an object-oriented implementation of functional data. It implements a unified framework for dense univariate and multivariate functional data on one- and higher dimensional domains as well as for irregular functional data. The aim of this package is to provide a user-friendly, self-contained core toolbox for functional data, including important functionalities for creating, accessing and modifying functional data objects, that can serve as a basis for other packages. The package further contains a full simulation toolbox, which is a useful feature when implementing and testing new methodological developments. Based on the theory of object-oriented data analysis, it is shown why it is natural to implement functional data in an object-oriented manner. The classes and methods provided by funData are illustrated in many examples using two freely available datasets. The MFPCA package, which implements multivariate functional principal component analysis, is presented as an example for an advanced methodological package that uses the funData package as a basis, including a case study with real data. Both packages are publicly available on GitHub and the Comprehensive R Archive Network.","The random-effects or normal-normal hierarchical model is commonly utilized in a wide range of meta-analysis applications. A Bayesian approach to inference is very attractive in this context, especially when a meta-analysis is based only on few studies. The bayesmeta R package provides readily accessible tools to perform Bayesian meta-analyses and generate plots and summaries, without having to worry about computational details. It allows for flexible prior specification and instant access to the resulting posterior distributions, including prediction and shrinkage estimation, and facilitating for example quick sensitivity checks. The present paper introduces the underlying theory and showcases its usage.","Sparse estimation via penalized likelihood (PL) is now a popular approach to learn the associations among a large set of variables. This paper describes an R package called lslx that implements PL methods for semi-confirmatory structural equation modeling (SEM). In this semi-confirmatory approach, each model parameter can be specified as free/fixed for theory testing, or penalized for exploration. By incorporating either a L1 or minimax concave penalty, the sparsity pattern of the parameter matrix can be efficiently explored. Package lslx minimizes the PL criterion through a quasi-Newton method. The algorithm conducts line search and checks the first-order condition in each iteration to ensure the optimality of the obtained solution. A numerical comparison between competing packages shows that lslx can reliably find PL estimates with the least time. The current package also supports other advanced functionalities, including a two-stage method with auxiliary variables for missing data handling and a reparameterized multi-group SEM to explore population heterogeneity.","An R package for computing the all-subsets regression problem is presented. The proposed algorithms are based on computational strategies recently developed. A novel algorithm for the best-subset regression problem selects subset models based on a predetermined criterion. The package user can choose from exact and from approximation algorithms. The core of the package is written in C++ and provides an efficient implementation of all the underlying numerical computations. A case study and benchmark results illustrate the usage and the computational efficiency of the package.","A wide range of chemical information is freely available online, including identifiers, experimental and predicted chemical properties. However, these data are scattered over various data sources and not easily accessible to researchers. Manual searching and downloading of such data is time-consuming and error-prone. We developed the open-source R package webchem that allows users to automatically query chemical data from currently 14 web sources. These cover a broad spectrum of information. The data are automatically imported into an R object and can directly be used in subsequent analyses. webchem enables easy, structured and reproducible data retrieval and usage from publicly available web sources. In addition, it facilitates data cleaning, identification and reporting of substances. Consequently, it reduces the time researchers need to spend on chemical data compilation.","To extend the current implementation of copulas in MATLAB to non-elliptical distributions in arbitrary dimensions enabling for asymmetries in the tails, the toolbox HACopula provides functionality for modeling with hierarchical (or nested) Archimedean copulas. This includes their representation as MATLAB objects, evaluation, sampling, estimation and goodness-of-fit testing, as well as tools for their visual representation or computation of corresponding matrices of Kendall's tau and tail dependence coefficients. These are first presented in a quick-and-simple manner and then elaborated in more detail to show the full capability of HACopula. As an example, sampling, estimation and goodness-of-fit of a 100-dimensional hierarchical Archimedean copula is presented, including a speed up of its computationally most demanding part. The toolbox is also compatible with Octave, where no support for copulas in more than two dimensions is currently provided.","The aim of the R package netCoin is to explore data structures using a number of statistical techniques that share the handling of interdependent variables. The main objective of this analysis is to detect events, characters, objects, attributes or characteristics that tend to appear together within a given set of scenarios. Its most notable feature is the combination of traditional multivariate statistical analysis and network analysis supported by topological graph theory. In addition, netCoin produces HTML graphs using the D3.js visualization library to support the interactive exploration of networked data. Among its many applications, netCoin can be used for the analysis of multiple responses in questionnaires to explore relevant associations, for the development of textual networks, for the study of ecological communities, for audience analysis, for mining large databases or for basket market analysis.","Algebraic methods have a long history in statistics. Apart from the ubiquitous applications of linear algebra, the most visible manifestations of modern algebra in statistics are found in the young field of algebraic statistics, which brings tools from commutative algebra and algebraic geometry to bear on statistical problems. Now over two decades old, algebraic statistics has applications in a wide range of theoretical and applied statistical domains. Nevertheless, algebraic statistical methods are still not mainstream, mostly due to a lack of easy off-the-shelf implementations. In this article we debut m2r, an R package that connects R to Macaulay2 through a persistent back-end socket connection running locally or on a cloud server. Topics range from basic use of m2r to applications and design philosophy.","In randomized controlled trials of seriously ill patients, death is common and often defined as the primary endpoint. Increasingly, non-mortality outcomes such as functional outcomes are co-primary or secondary endpoints. Functional outcomes are not defined for patients who die, referred to as \"truncation due to death\", and among survivors, functional outcomes are often unobserved due to missed clinic visits or loss to follow-up. It is well known that if the functional outcomes \"truncated due to death\" or missing are handled inappropriately, treatment effect estimation can be biased. In this paper, we describe the package idem that implements a procedure for comparing treatments that is based on a composite endpoint of mortality and the functional outcome among survivors. Among survivors, the procedure incorporates a missing data imputation procedure with a sensitivity analysis strategy. A web-based graphical user interface is provided in the idem package to facilitate users conducting the proposed analysis in an interactive and user-friendly manner. We demonstrate idem using data from a recent trial of sedation interruption among mechanically ventilated patients.","Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) have attracted increasing attention in educational measurement because of their potential to provide diagnostic feedback about students' strengths and weaknesses. This article introduces the feature-rich R package GDINA for conducting a variety of CDM analyses. Built upon a general model framework, a number of CDMs can be calibrated using the GDINA package. Functions are also available for evaluating model-data fit, detecting differential item functioning, validating the item and attribute association, and examining classification accuracy. A grapical user interface is also provided for researchers who are less familar with R. This paper contains both technical details about model estimation and illustrations about how to use the package for data analysis. The GDINA package is also used to replicate published results, showing that it could provide comparable model parameter estimation.","Fractional factorial experiments often produce ambiguous results due to confounding among the factors; as a consequence more than one model is consistent with the data. Thus, the practical problem is how to choose additional runs in order to discriminate among the rival models and to identify the active factors. The R package OBsMD solves this problem by implementing the objective Bayesian methodology proposed by Consonni and Deldossi (2016). The main feature of this approach is that the follow-up designs are obtained through the use of just two functions, OBsProb() and OMD() without requiring any prior specifications, being fully automatic. Thus OBsMD provides a simple tool for conducting a design of experiments to solve real world problems.","The BayesNetBP package has been developed for probabilistic reasoning and visualization in Bayesian networks with nodes that are purely discrete, continuous or mixed (discrete and continuous). Probabilistic reasoning enables a user to absorb information into a Bayesian network and make queries about how the probabilities within the network change in light of new information. The package was developed in the R programming language and is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. A shiny app with Cytoscape widgets provides an interactive interface for evidence absorption, queries, and visualizations.","We introduce a new R package, BeSS, for solving the best subset selection problem in linear, logistic and Cox's proportional hazard (CoxPH) models. It utilizes a highly efficient active set algorithm based on primal and dual variables, and supports sequential and golden search strategies for best subset selection. We provide a C++ implementation of the algorithm using an Rcpp interface. We demonstrate through numerical experiments based on enormous simulation and real datasets that the new BeSS package has competitive performance compared to other R packages for best subset selection purposes.","The R package AssocTests provides some procedures which are commonly used in genetic association studies. These procedures are population stratification correction through eigenvectors, principal coordinates of clusterings, Tracy-Widom test, distance regression, single-marker test, maximum test based on three Cochran-Armitage trend tests, non-parametric trend test, and non-parametric maximum test. The trait values for these methods should be discrete or continuous. The discrete traits can be coded by 1/0 for cases/controls. The genotype values can be 0, 1, or 2 indicating the number of risk alleles for a biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphism. This article introduces the methods and algorithms implemented in the package. Some examples are provided to illustrate the package's capability.","Although a very rich list of classes of space-time covariance functions exists, specific tools for selecting the appropriate class for a given data set are needed. Thus, the main topic of this paper is to present the new R package, covatest, which can be used for testing some characteristics of a covariance function, such as symmetry, separability and type of non-separability, as well as for testing the adequacy of some classes of space-time covariance models. These last aspects can be relevant for choosing a suitable class of covariance models. The proposed results have been applied to an environmental case study.","A large number of statistical decision problems in the social sciences and beyond can be framed as a (contextual) multi-armed bandit problem. However, it is notoriously hard to develop and evaluate policies that tackle these types of problems, and to use such policies in applied studies. To address this issue, this paper introduces StreamingBandit, a Python web application for developing and testing bandit policies in field studies. StreamingBandit can sequentially select treatments using (online) policies in real time. Once StreamingBandit is implemented in an applied context, different policies can be tested, altered, nested, and compared. StreamingBandit makes it easy to apply a multitude of bandit policies for sequential allocation in field experiments, and allows for the quick development and re-use of novel policies. In this article, we detail the implementation logic of StreamingBandit and provide several examples of its use.","Subset identification methods are used to select the subset of a covariate space over which the conditional distribution of a response has certain properties  -  for example, identifying types of patients whose conditional treatment effect is positive. An often critical requirement of subset identification methods is multiplicity control, by which the family-wise Type I error rate is controlled, rather than the Type I error rate of each covariate-determined hypothesis separately. The credible subset (or credible subgroup) method provides a multiplicity-controlled estimate of the target subset in the form of two bounding subsets: one which entirely contains the target subset, and one which is entirely contained by it. We introduce a new R package, credsubs, which constructs credible subset estimates using a sample from the joint posterior distribution of any regression model, a description of the covariate space, and a function mapping the parameters and covariates to the subset criterion. We demonstrate parametric and nonparametric applications of the package to a clinical trial dataset and a neuroimaging dataset, respectively.","Optimization plays an important role in many methods routinely used in statistics, machine learning and data science. Often, implementations of these methods rely on highly specialized optimization algorithms, designed to be only applicable within a specific application. However, in many instances recent advances, in particular in the field of convex optimization, make it possible to conveniently and straightforwardly use modern solvers instead with the advantage of enabling broader usage scenarios and thus promoting reusability. This paper introduces the R optimization infrastructure ROI which provides an extensible infrastructure to model linear, quadratic, conic and general nonlinear optimization problems in a consistent way. Furthermore, the infrastructure administers many different solvers, reformulations, problem collections and functions to read and write optimization problems in various formats.","We present the R package PResiduals for residual analysis using the probability-scale residual. This residual is well defined for a wide variety of outcome types and models, including some settings where other popular residuals are not applicable. It can be used for model diagnostics, tests of conditional associations, and covariate-adjustment for Spearman's rank correlation. These tests and measures of conditional association are applicable to any orderable variable. They use order information but do not require assigning scores to ordered categorical variables or transforming continuous variables, and therefore, can achieve a good balance between robustness and efficiency. We illustrate the usage of the PResiduals package with a publicly available dataset.","This article describes the R package BOIN, which implements a recently developed methodology for designing single-agent and drug-combination dose-finding clinical trials using Bayesian optimal interval designs (Liu and Yuan 2015; Yuan, Hess, Hilsenbeck, and Gilbert 2016). The BOIN designs are novel \"model-assisted\" phase I trial designs that can be implemented simply and transparently, similar to the 3 + 3 design, but yield excellent performance comparable to those of more complicated, model-based designs. The BOIN package provides tools for designing, conducting, and analyzing single-agent and drug-combination dose-finding trials.","We present the R package BASS as a tool for nonparametric regression. The primary focus of the package is fitting fully Bayesian adaptive spline surface (BASS) models and performing global sensitivity analyses of these models. The BASS framework is similar to that of Bayesian multivariate adaptive regression splines (BMARS) from Denison, Mallick, and Smith (1998), but with many added features. The software is built to efficiently handle significant amounts of data with many continuous or categorical predictors and with functional response. Under our Bayesian framework, most priors are automatic but these can be modified by the user to focus on parsimony and the avoidance of overfitting. If directed to do so, the software uses parallel tempering to improve the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) methods used to perform inference. We discuss the implementation of these features and present the performance of BASS in a number of analyses of simulated and real data.","The R add-on package FDboost is a flexible toolbox for the estimation of functional regression models by model-based boosting. It provides the possibility to fit regression models for scalar and functional response with effects of scalar as well as functional covariates, i.e., scalar-on-function, function-on-scalar and function-on-function regression models. In addition to mean regression, quantile regression models as well as generalized additive models for location scale and shape can be fitted with FDboost. Furthermore, boosting can be used in high-dimensional data settings with more covariates than observations. We provide a hands-on tutorial on model fitting and tuning, including the visualization of results. The methods for scalar-on-function regression are illustrated with spectrometric data of fossil fuels and those for functional response regression with a data set including bioelectrical signals for emotional episodes.","CVXR is an R package that provides an object-oriented modeling language for convex optimization, similar to CVX, CVXPY, YALMIP, and Convex.jl. It allows the user to formulate convex optimization problems in a natural mathematical syntax rather than the restrictive form required by most solvers. The user specifies an objective and set of constraints by combining constants, variables, and parameters using a library of functions with known mathematical properties. CVXR then applies signed disciplined convex programming (DCP) to verify the problem's convexity. Once verified, the problem is converted into standard conic form using graph implementations and passed to a cone solver such as ECOS or SCS. We demonstrate CVXR's modeling framework with several applications.","The Data Envelopment Analysis Toolbox is a new package for MATLAB that includes functions to calculate the main data envelopment analysis models. The package includes code for the standard radial input, output and additive measures, allowing for constant and variable returns to scale, as well as recent developments related to the directional distance function, and including both desirable and undesirable outputs when measuring efficiency and productivity; i.e., Malmquist and Malmquist-Luenberger indices. Bootstrapping to perform statistical analysis is also included. This paper describes the methodology and implementation of the functions, and reports numerical results using a reliable productivity database on US agriculture to illustrate their use.","The distribution of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test statistic has been widely studied under the assumption that the underlying theoretical cumulative distribution function (CDF), F (x), is continuous. However, there are many real-life applications in which fitting discrete or mixed distributions is required. Nevertheless, due to inherent difficulties, the distribution of the KS statistic when F (x) has jump discontinuities has been studied to a much lesser extent and no exact and efficient computational methods have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we provide a fast and accurate method to compute the (complementary) CDF of the KS statistic when F (x) is discontinuous, and thus obtain exact p values of the KS test. Our approach is to express the complementary CDF through the rectangle probability for uniform order statistics, and to compute it using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Secondly, we provide a C++ and an R implementation of the proposed method, which fills the existing gap in statistical software. We give also a useful extension of the Schmid's asymptotic formula for the distribution of the KS statistic, relaxing his requirement for F (x) to be increasing between jumps and thus allowing for any general mixed or purely discrete F (x). The numerical performance of the proposed FFT-based method, implemented both in C++ and in the R package KSgeneral, available from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KSgeneral, is illustrated when F (x) is mixed, purely discrete, and continuous. The performance of the general asymptotic formula is also studied.","Large networks of queueing systems model important real-world systems such as MapReduce clusters, web-servers, hospitals, call centers and airport passenger terminals. To model such systems accurately, we must infer queueing parameters from data. Unfortunately, for many queueing networks there is no clear way to proceed with parameter inference from data. Approximate Bayesian computation could offer a straightforward way to infer parameters for such networks if we could simulate data quickly enough. We present a computationally efficient method for simulating from a very general set of queueing networks with the R package queuecomputer. Remarkable speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude are observed relative to the popular DES packages simmer and simpy. We replicate output from these packages to validate the package. The package is modular and integrates well with the popular R package dplyr. Complex queueing networks with tandem, parallel and fork/join topologies can easily be built with these two packages together. We show how to use this package with two examples: a call center and an airport terminal.","Successful management of wildlife populations requires accurate estimates of abundance. Abundance estimates can be confounded by imperfect detection during wildlife surveys. N-mixture models enable quantification of detection probability and, under appropriate conditions, produce abundance estimates that are less biased. Here, we demonstrate how to use the R-INLA package for R to analyze N-mixture models, and compare performance of R-INLA to two other common approaches: JAGS (via the runjags package for R), which uses Markov chain Monte Carlo and allows Bayesian inference, and the unmarked package for R, which uses maximum likelihood and allows frequentist inference. We show that R-INLA is an attractive option for analyzing N-mixture models when (i) fast computing times are necessary (R-INLA is 10 times faster than unmarked and 500 times faster than JAGS), (ii) familiar model syntax and data format (relative to other R packages) is desired, (iii) survey-level covariates of detection are not essential, and (iv) Bayesian inference is preferred.","We describe the R package acebayes and demonstrate its use to find Bayesian optimal experimental designs. A decision-theoretic approach is adopted, with the optimal design maximizing an expected utility. Finding Bayesian optimal designs for realistic problems is challenging, as the expected utility is typically intractable and the design space may be high-dimensional. The package implements the approximate coordinate exchange algorithm to optimize (an approximation to) the expected utility via a sequence of conditional one-dimensional optimization steps. At each step, a Gaussian process regression model is used to approximate, and subsequently optimize, the expected utility as the function of a single design coordinate (the value taken by one controllable variable for one run of the experiment). In addition to functions for bespoke design problems with user-defined utility functions, acebayes provides functions tailored to finding designs for common generalized linear and nonlinear models. The package provides a step-change in the complexity of problems that can be addressed, enabling designs to be found for much larger numbers of variables and runs than previously possible. We provide tutorials on the application of the methodology for four illustrative examples of varying complexity where designs are found for the goals of parameter estimation, model selection and prediction. These examples demonstrate previously unseen functionality of acebayes.","Survival analysis features heavily as an important part of health economic evaluation, an increasingly important component of medical research. In this setting, it is important to estimate the mean time to the survival endpoint using limited information (typically from randomized trials) and thus it is useful to consider parametric survival models. In this paper, we review the features of the R package survHE, specifically designed to wrap several tools to perform survival analysis for economic evaluation. In particular, survHE embeds both a standard, frequentist analysis (through the R package flexsurv) and a Bayesian approach, based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (via the R package rstan) or integrated nested Laplace approximation (with the R package INLA). Using this composite approach, we obtain maximum flexibility and are able to pre-compile a wide range of parametric models, with a view of simplifying the modelers' work and allowing them to move away from non-optimal work flows, including spreadsheets (e.g., Microsoft Excel).","The phonics package provides several functions for indexing words by their English language pronunciation. Over nearly one hundred years, many different algorithms have been developed to support word and name indexing. From Soundex, developed in the early 20th century and predating the digital computer, through to modern digital phonetic algorithms like Phonex, the phonics package provides support for more than a dozen methods. Together, these provide phonetic algorithms appropriate for use in name indexing and name matching across a variety of English language use cases.","Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to \"the\" clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to \"robust\" covariance matrix estimation  -  applicable beyond lm() and glm()  -  is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in vcovCL(), vcovPL(), and vcovPC(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in vcovBS(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including MASS, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.","MultiBUGS is a new version of the general-purpose Bayesian modeling software BUGS that implements a generic algorithm for parallelizing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to speed up posterior inference of Bayesian models. The algorithm parallelizes evaluation of the product-form likelihoods formed when a parameter has many children in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation; and parallelizes sampling of conditionally-independent sets of parameters. A heuristic algorithm is used to decide which approach to use for each parameter and to apportion computation across computational cores. This enables MultiBUGS to automatically parallelize the broad range of statistical models that can be fitted using BUGS-language software, making the dramatic speed-ups of modern multi-core computing accessible to applied statisticians, without requiring any experience of parallel programming. We demonstrate the use of MultiBUGS on simulated data designed to mimic a hierarchical e-health linked-data study of methadone prescriptions including 425,112 observations and 20,426 random effects. Posterior inference for the e-health model takes several hours in existing software, but MultiBUGS can perform inference in only 28 minutes using 48 computational cores.","mlogit is a package for R which enables the estimation of random utility models with choice situation and/or alternative specific variables. The main extensions of the basic multinomial model (heteroscedastic, nested and random parameter models) are implemented.","Applications of multiple imputation have long outgrown the traditional context of dealing with item nonresponse in cross-sectional data sets. Nowadays multiple imputation is also applied to impute missing values in hierarchical data sets, address confidentiality concerns, combine data from different sources, or correct measurement errors in surveys. However, software developments did not keep up with these recent extensions. Most imputation software can only deal with item nonresponse in cross-sectional settings and extensions for hierarchical data  -  if available at all  -  are typically limited in scope. Furthermore, to our knowledge no software is currently available for dealing with measurement error using multiple imputation approaches. The R package hmi tries to close some of these gaps. It offers multiple imputation routines in hierarchical settings for many variable types (for example, nominal, ordinal, or continuous variables). It also provides imputation routines for interval data and handles a common measurement error problem in survey data: biased inferences due to implicit rounding of the reported values. The user-friendly setup which only requires the data and optionally the specification of the analysis model of interest makes the package especially attractive for users less familiar with the peculiarities of multiple imputation. The compatibility with the popular mice package (Van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2011) ensures that the rich set of analysis and diagnostic tools and post-imputation functions available in mice can be used easily, once the data have been imputed.","Image reconstruction from noisy data has a long history of methodological development and is based on a variety of ideas. In this paper we introduce a new method called patchwise adaptive smoothing, that extends the propagation-separation approach by using comparisons of local patches of image intensities to define local adaptive weighting schemes for an improved balance of reduced variability and bias in the reconstruction result. We present the implementation of the new method in an R package aws and demonstrate its properties on a number of examples in comparison with other state-of-the art image reconstruction methods.","GeneGeneInteR is an R package dedicated to the detection of an association between a case-control phenotype and the interaction between two sets of biallelic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) in case-control genome-wide associations studies. The development of statistical procedures for searching gene-gene interaction at the SNP-set level has indeed recently grown in popularity as these methods confer advantage in both statistical power and biological interpretation. However, all these methods have been implemented in home made softwares that are for most of them available only on request to the authors and at best have a web interface. Since the implementation of these methods is not straightforward, there is a need for a user-friendly tool to perform gene-based genegene interaction. The purpose of GeneGeneInteR is to propose a collection of tools for all the steps involved in gene-based gene-gene interaction testing in case-control association studies. Illustrated by an example of a dataset related to rheumatoid arthritis, this paper details the implementation of the functions available in GeneGeneInteR to perform an analysis of a collection of SNP sets. Such an analysis aims at addressing the complete statistical pipeline going from data importation to the visualization of the results through data manipulation and statistical analysis.","The LocalControl R package implements novel approaches to address biases and confounding when comparing treatments or exposures in observational studies of outcomes. While designed and appropriate for use in comparative safety and effectiveness research involving medicine and the life sciences, the package can be used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders. LocalControl is an open-source tool for researchers whose aim is to generate high quality evidence using observational data. The package implements a family of methods for non-parametric bias correction when comparing treatments in observational studies, including survival analysis settings, where competing risks and/or censoring may be present. The approach extends to bias-corrected personalized predictions of treatment outcome differences, and analysis of heterogeneity of treatment effect-sizes across patient subgroups.","This article introduces the GNAR package, which fits, predicts, and simulates from a powerful new class of generalized network autoregressive processes. Such processes consist of a multivariate time series along with a real, or inferred, network that provides information about inter-variable relationships. The GNAR model relates values of a time series for a given variable and time to earlier values of the same variable and of neighboring variables, with inclusion controlled by the network structure. The GNAR package is designed to fit this new model, while working with standard 'ts' objects and the igraph package for ease of use.","The R package colorspace provides a flexible toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in statistical graphics and data visualizations. In particular, the package provides a broad range of color palettes based on the HCL (hue-chroma-luminance) color space. The three HCL dimensions have been shown to match those of the human visual system very well, thus facilitating intuitive selection of color palettes through trajectories in this space. Using the HCL color model, general strategies for three types of palettes are implemented: (1) Qualitative for coding categorical information, i.e., where no particular ordering of categories is available. (2) Sequential for coding ordered/numeric information, i.e., going from high to low (or vice versa). (3) Diverging for coding ordered/numeric information around a central neutral value, i.e., where colors diverge from neutral to two extremes. To aid selection and application of these palettes, the package also contains scales for use with ggplot2, shiny and tcltk apps for interactive exploration, visualizations of palette properties, accompanying manipulation utilities (like desaturation and lighten/darken), and emulation of color vision deficiencies. The shiny apps are also hosted online at http://hclwizard.org/.","Discrete choice experiments are widely used in a broad area of research fields to capture the preference structure of respondents. The design of such experiments will determine to a large extent the accuracy with which the preference parameters can be estimated. This paper presents a new R package, called idefix, which enables users to generate optimal designs for discrete choice experiments. Besides Bayesian D-efficient designs for the multinomial logit model, the package includes functions to generate Bayesian adaptive designs which can be used to gather data for the mixed logit model. In addition, the package provides the necessary tools to set up actual surveys and collect empirical data. After data collection, idefix can be used to transform the data into the necessary format in order to use existing estimation software in R.","Traditional tools and software for social network analysis are seldom scalable and/or fast. This paper provides an overview of an R package called fastnet, a tool for scaling and speeding up the simulation and analysis of large-scale social networks. fastnet uses multi-core processing and sub-graph sampling algorithms to achieve the desired scale-up and speed-up. Simple examples, usages, and comparisons of scale-up and speed-up as compared to other R packages, i.e., igraph and statnet, are presented.","This paper introduces the R package ordinalCont, which implements an ordinal regression framework for response variables which are recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This scale is used when recording subjects' perception of an intangible quantity such as pain, anxiety or quality of life, and consists of a mark made on a linear scale. We implement continuous ordinal regression models for VAS as the appropriate method of analysis for such responses, and introduce smoothing terms and random effects in the linear predictor. The model parameters are estimated using constrained optimization of the penalized likelihood and the penalty parameters are automatically selected via maximization of their marginal likelihood. The estimation algorithm is shown to perform well, in a simulation study. Two examples of application are given: the first involves the analysis of pain outcomes in a clinical trial for laser treatment for chronic neck pain; the second is an analysis of quality of life outcomes in a clinical trial for chemotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer.","Wilcoxon rank-based tests are distribution-free alternatives to the popular two-sample and paired t tests. For independent data, they are available in several R packages such as stats and coin. For clustered data, in spite of the recent methodological developments, there did not exist an R package that makes them available at one place. We present a package clusrank where the latest developments are implemented and wrapped under a unified user-friendly interface. With different methods dispatched based on the inputs, this package offers great flexibility in rank-based tests for various clustered data. Exact tests based on permutations are also provided for some methods. Details of the major schools of different methods are briefly reviewed. Usages of the package clusrank are illustrated with simulated data as well as a real dataset from an ophthalmological study. The package also enables convenient comparison between selected methods under settings that have not been studied before and the results are discussed.","Forest inventories provide reliable evidence-based information to assess the state and development of forests over time. They typically consist of a random sample of plot locations in the forest that are assessed individually by field crews. Due to the high costs of these terrestrial campaigns, remote sensing information available in high quantity and low costs is frequently incorporated in the estimation process in order to reduce inventory costs or improve estimation precision. With respect to this objective, the application of multiphase forest inventory methods (e.g., double- and triple-sampling regression estimators) has proved to be efficient. While these methods have been successfully applied in practice, the availability of open-source software has been rare if not non-existent. The R package forestinventory provides a comprehensive set of global and small area regression estimators for multiphase forest inventories under simple and cluster sampling. The implemented methods have been demonstrated in various scientific studies ranging from small to large scale forest inventories, and can be used for post-stratification, regression and regression within strata. This article gives an extensive review of the mathematical theory of this family of design-based estimators, puts them into a common framework of forest inventory scenarios and demonstrates their application in the R environment.","The simsurv R package allows users to simulate survival (i.e., time-to-event) data from standard parametric distributions (exponential, Weibull, and Gompertz), two-component mixture distributions, or a user-defined hazard function. Baseline covariates can be included under a proportional hazards assumption. Clustered event times, for example individuals within a family, are also easily accommodated. Time-dependent effects (i.e., nonproportional hazards) can be included by interacting covariates with linear time or a user-defined function of time. Under a user-defined hazard function, event times can be generated for a variety of complex models such as flexible (spline-based) baseline hazards, models with time-varying covariates, or joint longitudinal-survival models.","The R package microsynth has been developed for implementation of the synthetic control methodology for comparative case studies involving micro- or meso-level data. The methodology implemented within microsynth is designed to assess the efficacy of a treatment or intervention within a well-defined geographic region that is itself a composite of several smaller regions (where data are available at the more granular level for comparison regions as well). The effect of the intervention on one or more time-varying outcomes is evaluated by determining a synthetic control region that resembles the treatment region across pre-intervention values of the outcome(s) and time-invariant covariates and that is a weighted composite of many untreated comparison regions. The microsynth procedure includes functionality that enables its user to (1) calculate weights for synthetic control, (2) tabulate results for statistical inferences, and (3) create time series plots of outcomes for treatment and synthetic control. In this article, microsynth is described in detail and its application is illustrated using data from a drug market intervention in Seattle, WA.","In this article, we introduce the BART R package which is an acronym for Bayesian additive regression trees. BART is a Bayesian nonparametric, machine learning, ensemble predictive modeling method for continuous, binary, categorical and time-to-event outcomes. Furthermore, BART is a tree-based, black-box method which fits the outcome to an arbitrary random function, f , of the covariates. The BART technique is relatively computationally efficient as compared to its competitors, but large sample sizes can be demanding. Therefore, the BART package includes efficient state-of-the-art implementations for continuous, binary, categorical and time-to-event outcomes that can take advantage of modern off-the-shelf hardware and software multi-threading technology. The BART package is written in C++ for both programmer and execution efficiency. The BART package takes advantage of multi-threading via forking as provided by the parallel package and OpenMP when available and supported by the platform. The ensemble of binary trees produced by a BART fit can be stored and re-used later via the R predict function. In addition to being an R package, the installed BART routines can be called directly from C++. The BART package provides the tools for your BART toolbox.","FamEvent is a comprehensive R package for simulating and modeling age-at-disease onset in families carrying a rare gene mutation. The package can simulate complex family data for variable time-to-event outcomes under three common family study designs (population, high-risk clinic and multi-stage) with various levels of missing genetic information among family members. Residual familial correlation can be induced through the inclusion of a frailty term or a second gene. Disease-gene carrier probabilities are evaluated assuming Mendelian transmission or empirically from the data. When genetic information on the disease gene is missing, an expectation-maximization algorithm is employed to calculate the carrier probabilities. Penetrance model functions with ascertainment correction adapted to the sampling design provide age-specific cumulative disease risks by sex, mutation status, and other covariates for simulated data as well as real data analysis. Robust standard errors and 95% confidence intervals are available for these estimates. Plots of pedigrees and penetrance functions based on the fitted model provide graphical displays to evaluate and summarize the models.","Time series data, i.e., temporally ordered data, is routinely collected and analysed in in many fields of natural science, economy, technology and medicine, where it is of importance to verify the assumption of stochastic stationarity prior to modeling the data. Nonstationarities in the data are often attributed to structural changes with segments between adjacent change-points being approximately stationary. A particularly important, and thus widely studied, problem in statistics and signal processing is to detect changes in the mean at unknown time points. In this paper, we present the R package mosum, which implements elegant and mathematically well-justified procedures for the multiple mean change problem using the moving sum statistics.","Structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models are frequently applied to trace the contemporaneous linkages among (macroeconomic) variables back to an interplay of orthogonal structural shocks. Under Gaussianity the structural parameters are unidentified without additional (often external and not data-based) information. In contrast, the often reasonable assumption of heteroskedastic and/or non-Gaussian model disturbances offers the possibility to identify unique structural shocks. We describe the R package svars which implements statistical identification techniques that can be both heteroskedasticity-based or independence-based. Moreover, it includes a rich variety of analysis tools that are well known in the SVAR literature. Next to a comprehensive review of the theoretical background, we provide a detailed description of the associated R functions. Furthermore, a macroeconomic application serves as a step-by-step guide on how to apply these functions to the identification and interpretation of structural VAR models.","The rapid development of modern technology has created many complex datasets in non-linear spaces, while most of the statistical hypothesis tests are only available in Euclidean or Hilbert spaces. To properly analyze the data with more complicated structures, efforts have been made to solve the fundamental test problems in more general spaces (Lyons 2013; Pan, Tian, Wang, and Zhang 2018; Pan, Wang, Zhang, Zhu, and Zhu 2020). In this paper, we introduce a publicly available R package Ball for the comparison of multiple distributions and the test of mutual independence in metric spaces, which extends the test procedures for the equality of two distributions (Pan et al. 2018) and the independence of two random objects (Pan et al. 2020). The Ball package is computationally efficient since several novel algorithms as well as engineering techniques are employed in speeding up the ball test procedures. Two real data analyses and diverse numerical studies have been performed, and the results certify that the Ball package can detect various distribution differences and complicated dependencies in complex datasets, e.g., directional data and symmetric positive definite matrix data.","In several applied fields, multimodality assessment is a crucial task as a previous exploratory tool or for determining the suitability of certain distributions. The goal of this paper is to present the utilities of the R package multimode, which collects different exploratory and testing non-parametric approaches for determining the number of modes and their estimated location. Specifically, some graphical tools (SiZer map, mode tree or mode forest) are provided, allowing for the identification of mode patterns, based on the kernel density estimation. Several formal testing procedures for determining the number of modes are described in this paper and implemented in the multimode package, including methods based on the ideas of the critical bandwidth, the excess mass or using a combination of both. This package also includes a function for estimating the modes locations and different classical data examples that have been considered in mode testing literature.","Checking data quality against domain knowledge is a common activity that pervades statistical analysis from raw data to output. The R package validate facilitates this task by capturing and applying expert knowledge in the form of validation rules: logical restrictions on variables, records, or data sets that should be satisfied before they are considered valid input for further analysis. In the validate package, validation rules are objects of computation that can be manipulated, investigated, and confronted with data or versions of a data set. The results of a confrontation are then available for further investigation, summarization or visualization. Validation rules can also be endowed with metadata and documentation and they may be stored or retrieved from external sources such as text files or tabular formats. This data validation infrastructure thus allows for systematic, user-defined definition of data quality requirements that can be reused for various versions of a data set or by data correction algorithms that are parameterized by validation rules.","The MixGHD package for R performs model-based clustering, classification, and discriminant analysis using the generalized hyperbolic distribution (GHD). This approach is suitable for data that can be considered a realization of a (multivariate) continuous random variable. The GHD has the advantage of being flexible due to skewness, concentration, and index parameters; as such, clustering methods that use this distribution are capable of estimating clusters characterized by different shapes. The package provides five different models all based on the GHD, an efficient routine for discriminant analysis, and a function to measure cluster agreement. This paper is split into three parts: the first is devoted to the formulation of each method, extending them for classification and discriminant analysis applications, the second focuses on the algorithms, and the third shows the use of the package on real datasets.","FRK is an R software package for spatial/spatio-temporal modeling and prediction with large datasets. It facilitates optimal spatial prediction (kriging) on the most commonly used manifolds (in Euclidean space and on the surface of the sphere), for both spatial and spatio-temporal fields. It differs from many of the packages for spatial modeling and prediction by avoiding stationary and isotropic covariance and variogram models, instead constructing a spatial random effects (SRE) model on a fine-resolution discretized spatial domain. The discrete element is known as a basic areal unit (BAU), whose introduction in the software leads to several practical advantages. The software can be used to (i) integrate multiple observations with different supports with relative ease; (ii) obtain exact predictions at millions of prediction locations (without conditional simulation); and (iii) distinguish between measurement error and fine-scale variation at the resolution of the BAU, thereby allowing for reliable uncertainty quantification. The temporal component is included by adding another dimension. A key component of the SRE model is the specification of spatial or spatio-temporal basis functions; in the package, they can be generated automatically or by the user. The package also offers automatic BAU construction, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation, and functionality for prediction over any user-specified polygons or BAUs. Use of the package is illustrated on several spatial and spatio-temporal datasets, and its predictions and the model it implements are extensively compared to others commonly used for spatial prediction and modeling.","A plethora of disparate statistical methods have been proposed for subgroup identification to help tailor treatment decisions for patients. However a majority of them do not have corresponding R packages and the few that do pertain to particular statistical methods or provide little means of evaluating whether meaningful subgroups have been found. Recently, the work of Chen, Tian, Cai, and Yu (2017) unified many of these subgroup identification methods into one general, consistent framework. The goal of the personalized package is to provide a corresponding unified software framework for subgroup identification analyses that provides not only estimation of subgroups, but evaluation of treatment effects within estimated subgroups. The personalized package allows for a variety of subgroup identification methods for many types of outcomes commonly encountered in medical settings. The package is built to incorporate the entire subgroup identification analysis pipeline including propensity score diagnostics, subgroup estimation, analysis of the treatment effects within subgroups, and evaluation of identified subgroups. In this framework, different methods can be accessed with little change in the analysis code. Similarly, new methods can easily be incorporated into the package. Besides familiar statistical models, the package also allows flexible machine learning tools to be leveraged in subgroup identification. Further estimation improvements can be obtained via efficiency augmentation.","NScluster is an R package used for simulation and parameter estimation for NeymanScott cluster point process models and their extensions. For parameter estimation, NScluster uses the maximum Palm likelihood estimation procedure. As some estimation procedures proposed herein require heavy calculation, NScluster can use parallel computation via OpenMP and achieve significant speedup in some cases. In this paper, we discuss results obtained using a laptop PC and a shared memory supercomputer. In addition, we examine the performance characteristics of parallel computation via OpenMP.","Conformal predictors estimate the reliability of outcomes made by supervised machine learning models. Instead of a point value, conformal prediction defines an outcome region that meets a user-specified reliability threshold. Provided that the data are independently and identically distributed, the user can control the level of the prediction errors and adjust it following the requirements of a given application. The quality of conformal predictions often depends on the choice of nonconformity estimate for a given machine learning method. To promote the selection of a successful approach, we have developed Orange3-Conformal, a Python library that provides a range of conformal prediction methods for classification and regression. The library also implements several nonconformity scores. It has a modular design and can be extended to add new conformal prediction methods and nonconformities.","Monitoring data while it is processed and transformed can yield detailed insight into the dynamics of a (running) production system. The lumberjack package is a lightweight package allowing users to follow how an R object is transformed as it is manipulated by R code. The package abstracts all logging code from the user, who only needs to specify which objects are logged and what information should be logged. A few default loggers are included with the package but the package is extensible through user-defined logger objects.","Multiplex social networks are characterized by a common set of actors connected through multiple types of relations. The multinet package provides a set of R functions to analyze multiplex social networks within the more general framework of multilayer networks, where each type of relation is represented as a layer in the network. The package contains functions to import/export, create and manipulate multilayer networks, implementations of several state-of-the-art multiplex network analysis algorithms, e.g., for centrality measures, layer comparison, community detection and visualization. Internally, the package is mainly written in native C++ and integrated with R using the Rcpp package.","The INLAMSM package for the R programming language provides a collection of multivariate spatial models for lattice data that can be used with the INLA package for Bayesian inference. The multivariate spatial models implemented include different structures to model the spatial variation of the variables and the between-variables variability. In this way, fitting multivariate spatial models becomes faster and easier. The use of the different models included in the package is illustrated using two different datasets: the well-known North Carolina SIDS data and mortality by three causes of death in Comunidad Valenciana (Spain).","Even though adaptive two-stage designs with unblinded interim analyses are becoming increasingly popular in clinical trial designs, there is a lack of statistical software to make their application more straightforward. The package adoptr fills this gap for the common case of two-stage one- or two-arm trials with (approximately) normally distributed outcomes. In contrast to previous approaches, adoptr optimizes the entire design upfront which allows maximal efficiency. To facilitate experimentation with different objective functions, adoptr supports a flexible way of specifying both (composite) objective scores and (conditional) constraints by the user. Special emphasis was put on providing measures to aid practitioners with the validation process of the package.","This paper describes the R package EpiILMCT, which allows users to study the spread of infectious disease using continuous time individual level models (ILMs). The package provides tools for simulation from continuous time ILMs that are based on either spatial demographic, contact network, or a combination of both of them, and for the graphical summarization of epidemics. Model fitting is carried out within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. The continuous time ILMs can be implemented within either susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) or susceptible-infected-notified-removed (SIN R) compartmental frameworks. As infectious disease data is often partially observed, data uncertainties in the form of missing infection times  -  and in some situations missing removal times  -  are accounted for using data augmentation techniques. The package is illustrated using both simulated and an experimental data set on the spread of the tomato spotted wilt virus disease.","\"Optimal cutpoints\" for binary classification tasks are often established by testing which cutpoint yields the best discrimination, for example the Youden index, in a specific sample. This results in \"optimal\" cutpoints that are highly variable and systematically overestimate the out-of-sample performance. To address these concerns, the cutpointr package offers robust methods for estimating optimal cutpoints and the out-of-sample performance. The robust methods include bootstrapping and smoothing based on kernel estimation, generalized additive models, smoothing splines, and local regression. These methods can be applied to a wide range of binary-classification and cost-based metrics. cutpointr also provides mechanisms to utilize user-defined metrics and estimation methods. The package has capabilities for parallelization of the bootstrapping, including reproducible random number generation. Furthermore, it is pipe-friendly, for example for compatibility with functions from tidyverse. Various functions for plotting receiver operating characteristic curves, precision recall graphs, bootstrap results and other representations of the data are included. The package contains example data from a study on psychological characteristics and suicide attempts suitable for applying binary classification algorithms.","An increasing number of time-consuming simulators exhibit a complex noise structure that depends on the inputs. For conducting studies with limited budgets of evaluations, new surrogate methods are required in order to simultaneously model the mean and variance fields. To this end, we present the hetGP package, implementing many recent advances in Gaussian process modeling with input-dependent noise. First, we describe a simple, yet efficient, joint modeling framework that relies on replication for both speed and accuracy. Then we tackle the issue of data acquisition leveraging replication and exploration in a sequential manner for various goals, such as for obtaining a globally accurate model, for optimization, or for contour finding. Reproducible illustrations are provided throughout.","Gene expression data provide an abundant resource for inferring connections in gene regulatory networks. While methodologies developed for this task have shown success, a challenge remains in comparing the performance among methods. Gold-standard datasets are scarce and limited in use. And while tools for simulating expression data are available, they are not designed to resemble the data obtained from RNA-seq experiments. SeqNet is an R package that provides tools for generating a rich variety of gene network structures and simulating RNA-seq data from them. This produces in silico RNA-seq data for benchmarking and assessing gene network inference methods. The package is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network at https://CRAN.R-project.org/package= SeqNet and on GitHub at https://github.com/tgrimes/SeqNet.","We present mexhaz, an R package for fitting flexible hazard-based regression models with the possibility to add time-dependent effects of covariates and to account for a twolevel hierarchical structure in the data through the inclusion of a normally distributed random intercept (i.e., a log-normally distributed shared frailty). Moreover, mexhazbased models can be fitted within the excess hazard setting by allowing the specification of an expected hazard in the model. These models are of common use in the context of the analysis of population-based cancer registry data. Follow-up time can be entered in the right-censored or counting process input style, the latter allowing models with delayed entries. The logarithm of the baseline hazard can be flexibly modeled with B-splines or restricted cubic splines of time. Parameters estimation is based on likelihood maximization: in deriving the contribution of each observation to the cluster-specific conditional likelihood, Gauss-Legendre quadrature is used to calculate the cumulative hazard; the cluster-specific marginal likelihoods are then obtained by integrating over the random effects distribution, using adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Functions to compute and plot the predicted (excess) hazard and (net) survival (possibly with cluster-specific predictions in the case of random effect models) are provided. We illustrate the use of the different options of the mexhaz package and compare the results obtained with those of other available R packages.","Multivariate time series observations are increasingly common in multiple fields of science but the complex dependencies of such data often translate into intractable models with large number of parameters. An alternative is given by first reducing the dimension of the series and then modelling the resulting uncorrelated signals univariately, avoiding the need for any covariance parameters. A popular and effective framework for this is blind source separation. In this paper we review the dimension reduction tools for time series available in the R package tsBSS. These include methods for estimating the signal dimension of second-order stationary time series, dimension reduction techniques for stochastic volatility models and supervised dimension reduction tools for time series regression. Several examples are provided to illustrate the functionality of the package.","Random variables and their distributions are a central part in many areas of statistical methods. The Distributions.jl package provides Julia users and developers tools for working with probability distributions, leveraging Julia features for their intuitive and flexible manipulation, while remaining highly efficient through zero-cost abstractions.","We provide a hands-on introduction to optimized textual sentiment indexation using the R package sentometrics. Textual sentiment analysis is increasingly used to unlock the potential information value of textual data. The sentometrics package implements an intuitive framework to efficiently compute sentiment scores of numerous texts, to aggregate the scores into multiple time series, and to use these time series to predict other variables. The workflow of the package is illustrated with a built-in corpus of news articles from two major U.S. journals to forecast the CBOE Volatility Index.","This paper describes the R package cold for the analysis of count longitudinal data. In this package marginal and random effects models are considered. In both cases estimation is via maximization of the exact likelihood and serial dependence among observations is assumed to be of Markovian type and referred as the integer-valued autoregressive of order one process. For random effects models adaptive Gaussian quadrature and Monte Carlo methods are used to compute integrals whose dimension depends on the structure of random effects. cold is written partly in R language, partly in Fortran 77, interfaced through R and is built following the S4 formulation of R methods.","The R package skpr provides a suite of functions to generate and evaluate experimental designs. Package skpr generates D, I, Alias, A, E, T, and G-optimal designs, and supports custom user-defined optimality criteria, N-level split-plot designs, mixture designs, and design augmentation. Also included are a collection of analytic and Monte Carlo power evaluation functions for normal, non-normal, random effects, and survival models, as well as tools to plot fraction of design space plots and correlation maps. Additionally, skpr includes a flexible framework for the user to perform custom power analyses with external libraries and user-defined functions, as well as a graphical user interface that wraps most of the functionality of the package in a point-and-click web application.","The aim of this paper is to describe the implementation and to provide a tutorial for the R package ssmrob, which is developed for robust estimation and inference in sample selection and endogenous treatment models. The sample selectivity issue occurs in practice in various fields, when a non-random sample of a population is observed, i.e., when observations are present according to some selection rule. It is well known that the classical estimators introduced by Heckman (1979) are very sensitive to small deviations from the distributional assumptions (typically the normality assumption on the error terms). Zhelonkin, Genton, and Ronchetti (2016) investigated the robustness properties of these estimators and proposed robust alternatives to the estimator and the corresponding test. We briefly discuss the robust approach and demonstrate its performance in practice by providing several empirical examples. The package can be used both to produce a complete robust statistical analysis of these models which complements the classical one and as a set of useful tools for exploratory data analysis. Specifically, robust estimators and standard errors of the coefficients of both the selection and the regression equations are provided together with a robust test of selectivity. The package therefore provides additional useful information to practitioners in different fields of applications by enhancing their statistical analysis of these models.","Causal effect identification considers whether an interventional probability distribution can be uniquely determined without parametric assumptions from measured source distributions and structural knowledge on the generating system. While complete graphical criteria and procedures exist for many identification problems, there are still challenging but important extensions that have not been considered in the literature such as combined transportability and selection bias, or multiple sources of selection bias. To tackle these new settings, we present a search algorithm directly over the rules of do-calculus. Due to the generality of do-calculus, the search is capable of taking more advanced datagenerating mechanisms into account along with an arbitrary type of both observational and experimental source distributions. The search is enhanced via a heuristic and search space reduction techniques. The approach, called do-search, is provably sound, and it is complete with respect to identifiability problems that have been shown to be completely characterized by do-calculus. When extended with additional rules, the search is capable of handling missing data problems as well. With the versatile search, we are able to approach new problems for which no other algorithmic solutions exist. We perform a systematic analysis of bivariate missing data problems and study causal inference under case-control design. We also present the R package dosearch that provides an interface for a C++ implementation of the search.","Regularization techniques such as the lasso (Tibshirani 1996) and elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005) can be used to improve regression model coefficient estimation and prediction accuracy, as well as to perform variable selection. Ordinal regression models are widely used in applications where the use of regularization could be beneficial; however, these models are not included in many popular software packages for regularized regression. We propose a coordinate descent algorithm to fit a broad class of ordinal regression models with an elastic net penalty. Furthermore, we demonstrate that each model in this class generalizes to a more flexible form, that can be used to model either ordered or unordered categorical response data. We call this the elementwise link multinomial-ordinal class, and it includes widely used models such as multinomial logistic regression (which also has an ordinal form) and ordinal logistic regression (which also has an unordered multinomial form). We introduce an elastic net penalty class that applies to either model form, and additionally, this penalty can be used to shrink a non-ordinal model toward its ordinal counterpart. Finally, we introduce the R package ordinalNet, which implements the algorithm for this model class.","The dynamichazard package implements state space models that can provide a computationally efficient way to model time-varying parameters in survival analysis. I cover the models and some of the estimation methods implemented in dynamichazard, apply them to a large data set, and perform a simulation study to illustrate the methods' computation time and performance. One of the methods is compared with other models implemented in R which allow for left-truncation, right-censoring, time-varying covariates, and timevarying parameters.","Model selection in mixed models based on the conditional distribution is appropriate for many practical applications and has been a focus of recent statistical research. In this paper we introduce the R package cAIC4 that allows for the computation of the conditional Akaike information criterion (cAIC). Computation of the conditional AIC needs to take into account the uncertainty of the random effects variance and is therefore not straightforward. We introduce a fast and stable implementation for the calculation of the cAIC for (generalized) linear mixed models estimated with lme4 and (generalized) additive mixed models estimated with gamm4. Furthermore, cAIC4 offers a stepwise function that allows for an automated stepwise selection scheme for mixed models based on the cAIC. Examples of many possible applications are presented to illustrate the practical impact and easy handling of the package.","Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a popular distance measure for time series analysis and has been applied in many research domains. This paper proposes the R package IncDTW for the incremental calculation of DTW, and based on this principle IncDTW also helps to classify or cluster time series, or perform subsequence matching and k-nearest neighbor search. DTW can measure dissimilarity between two temporal sequences which may vary in speed, with a major downside of high computational costs. Especially for analyzing live data streams, subsequence matching or calculating pairwise distance matrices, runtime intensive computations are unfavorable or can even make the analysis intractable. IncDTW tackles this problem by a vector-based implementation of the DTW algorithm to reduce the space complexity from a quadratic to a linear level in number of observations, and an incremental calculation of DTW for updating interim results to reduce the runtime complexity for online applications. We discuss the fundamental functionalities of IncDTW and apply the package to classify multivariate live stream accelerometer time series for activity recognition. Finally, comparative runtime experiments with various R and Python packages for various data analysis tasks emphasize the broad applicability of IncDTW.","Functional spatio-temporal data naturally arise in many environmental and climate applications where data are collected in a three-dimensional space over time. The MATLAB D-STEM v1 software package was first introduced for modeling multivariate space-time data and has been recently extended to D-STEM v2 to handle functional data indexed across space and over time. This paper introduces the new modeling capabilities of DSTEM v2 as well as the complexity reduction techniques required when dealing with large data sets. Model estimation, validation and dynamic kriging are demonstrated in two case studies, one related to ground-level air quality data in Beijing, China, and the other one related to atmospheric profile data collected globally through radio sounding.","Statistical analyses of directional or angular data have applications in a variety of fields, such as geology, meteorology and bioinformatics. There is substantial literature on descriptive and inferential techniques for univariate angular data, with the bivariate (or more generally, multivariate) cases receiving more attention in recent years. More specifically, the bivariate wrapped normal, von Mises sine and von Mises cosine distributions, and mixtures thereof, have been proposed for practical use. However, there is a lack of software implementing these distributions and the associated inferential techniques. In this article, we introduce BAMBI, an R package for analyzing bivariate (and univariate) angular data. We implement random data generation, density evaluation, and computation of theoretical summary measures (variances and correlation coefficients) for the three aforementioned bivariate angular distributions, as well as two univariate angular distributions: the univariate wrapped normal and the univariate von Mises distribution. The major contribution of BAMBI to statistical computing is in providing Bayesian methods for modeling angular data using finite mixtures of these distributions. We also provide functions for visual and numerical diagnostics and Bayesian inference for the fitted models. In this article, we first provide a brief review of the distributions and techniques used in BAMBI, then describe the capabilities of the package, and finally conclude with demonstrations of mixture model fitting using BAMBI on the two real data sets included in the package, one univariate and one bivariate.","Recent methodological researches produced permutation methods to test parameters in presence of nuisance variables in linear models or repeated measures ANOVA. Permutation tests are also particularly useful to overcome the multiple comparisons problem as they are used to test the effect of factors or variables on signals while controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER). This article introduces the permuco package which implements several permutation methods. They can all be used jointly with multiple comparisons procedures like the cluster-mass tests or threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE). The permuco package is designed, first, for univariate permutation tests with nuisance variables, like regression and ANOVA; and secondly, for comparing signals as required, for example, for the analysis of event-related potential (ERP) of experiments using electroencephalography (EEG). This article describes the permutation methods and the multiple comparisons procedures implemented. A tutorial for each of theses cases is provided.","The spatial scan statistic is commonly used to detect spatial disease clusters in epidemiological studies. Among the various types of scan statistics, the flexible scan statistic proposed by Tango and Takahashi (2005) is one of the most promising methods to detect arbitrarily-shaped clusters. In this paper, we introduce a new R package, rflexscan (Otani and Takahashi 2021), that provides efficient and easy-to-use methods for analyses of spatial count data using the flexible spatial scan statistic. The package is designed for any of the following interrelated purposes: to evaluate whether reported spatial disease clusters are statistically significant, to test whether a disease is randomly distributed over space, and to perform geographical surveillance of disease to detect areas of significantly high rates. The functionality of the package is demonstrated through an application to a public-domain small-area cancer incidence dataset in New York State, USA, between 2005 and 2009.","Recently, there has been a growing interest in tensor data analysis, where tensor regression is the cornerstone of statistical modeling for tensor data. The R package TRES provides the standard least squares estimators and the more efficient envelope estimators for the tensor response regression (TRR) and the tensor predictor regression (TPR) models. Envelope methodology provides a relatively new class of dimension reduction techniques that jointly models the regression mean and covariance parameters. Three types of widely applicable envelope estimation algorithms are implemented and applied to both TRR and TPR models.","The investigation of subgroups is an integral part of randomized clinical trials. Exploration of treatment effect heterogeneity is typically performed by covariate-adjusted analyses including treatment-by-covariate interactions. Several statistical techniques, such as model averaging and bagging, were proposed recently to address the problem of selection bias in treatment effect estimates for subgroups. In this paper, we describe the subtee R package for subgroup treatment effect estimation. The package can be used for all commonly encountered type of outcomes in clinical trials (continuous, binary, survival, count). We also provide additional functions to build the subgroup variables to be used and to plot the results using forest plots. The functions are demonstrated using data from a clinical trial investigating a treatment for prostate cancer with a survival endpoint.","nimble is an R package for constructing algorithms and conducting inference on hierarchical models. The nimble package provides a unique combination of flexible model specification and the ability to program model-generic algorithms. Specifically, the package allows users to code models in the BUGS language, and it allows users to write algorithms that can be applied to any appropriate model. In this paper, we introduce the nimbleSMC R package. nimbleSMC contains algorithms for state-space model analysis using sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) techniques that are built using nimble. We first provide an overview of state-space models and commonly-used SMC algorithms. We then describe how to build a state-space model in nimble and conduct inference using existing SMC algorithms within nimbleSMC. SMC algorithms within nimbleSMC currently include the bootstrap filter, auxiliary particle filter, ensemble Kalman filter, IF2 method of iterated filtering, and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. These algorithms can be run in R or compiled into C++ for more efficient execution. Examples of applying SMC algorithms to linear autoregressive models and a stochastic volatility model are provided. Finally, we give an overview of how model-generic algorithms are coded within nimble by providing code for a simple SMC algorithm. This illustrates how users can easily extend nimble's SMC methods in high-level code.","In this study, we present a new module built for users interested in a programming language similar to BUGS to fit a Bayesian model based on the piecewise exponential (PE) distribution. The module is an extension to the open-source program JAGS by which a Gibbs sampler can be applied without requiring the derivation of complete conditionals and the subsequent implementation of strategies to draw samples from unknown distributions. The PE distribution is widely used in the fields of survival analysis and reliability. Currently, it can only be implemented in JAGS through methods to indirectly specify the likelihood based on the Poisson or Bernoulli probabilities. Our module provides a more straightforward implementation and is thus more attractive to the researchers aiming to spend more time exploring the results from the Bayesian inference rather than implementing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. For those interested in extending JAGS, this work can be seen as a tutorial including important information not well investigated or organized in other materials. Here, we describe how to use the module taking advantage of the interface between R and JAGS. A short simulation study is developed to ensure that the module behaves well and a real illustration, involving two PE models, exhibits a context where the module can be used in practice.","ABCpy is a highly modular scientific library for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) written in Python. The main contribution of this paper is to document a software engineering effort that enables domain scientists to easily apply ABC to their research without being ABC experts; using ABCpy they can easily run large parallel simulations without much knowledge about parallelization. Further, ABCpy enables ABC experts to easily develop new inference schemes and evaluate them in a standardized environment and to extend the library with new algorithms. These benefits come mainly from the modularity of ABCpy. We give an overview of the design of ABCpy and provide a performance evaluation concentrating on parallelization. This points us towards the inherent imbalance in some of the ABC algorithms. We develop a dynamic scheduling MPI implementation to mitigate this issue and evaluate the various ABC algorithms according to their adaptability towards high-performance computing.","Traditional regression models, including generalized linear mixed models, focus on understanding the deterministic factors that affect the mean of a response variable. Many biological studies seek to understand non-deterministic patterns in the variance or dispersion of a phenotypic or ecological response variable. We describe a new R package, dalmatian, that provides methods for fitting double hierarchical generalized linear models incorporating fixed and random predictors of both the mean and variance. Models are fit via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling implemented in either JAGS or nimble and the package provides simple functions for monitoring the sampler and summarizing the results. We illustrate these functions through an application to data on food delivery by breeding pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Our intent is that this package makes it easier for practitioners to implement these models without having to learn the intricacies of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.","Booming in business and a staple analysis in medical trials, the A/B test assesses the effect of an intervention or treatment by comparing its success rate with that of a control condition. Across many practical applications, it is desirable that (1) evidence can be obtained in favor of the null hypothesis that the treatment is ineffective; (2) evidence can be monitored as the data accumulate; (3) expert prior knowledge can be taken into account. Most existing approaches do not fulfill these desiderata. Here we describe a Bayesian A/B procedure based on Kass and Vaidyanathan (1992) that allows one to monitor the evidence for the hypotheses that the treatment has either a positive effect, a negative effect, or, crucially, no effect. Furthermore, this approach enables one to incorporate expert knowledge about the relative prior plausibility of the rival hypotheses and about the expected size of the effect, given that it is non-zero. To facilitate the wider adoption of this Bayesian procedure we developed the abtest package in R. We illustrate the package options and the associated statistical results with a fictitious business example and a real data medical example.","Item response theory (IRT) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons' responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective pre-specified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. I demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and postprocessed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.","The INLA package provides a tool for computationally efficient Bayesian modeling and inference for various widely used models, more formally the class of latent Gaussian models. It is a non-sampling based framework which provides approximate results for Bayesian inference, using sparse matrices. The swift uptake of this framework for Bayesian modeling is rooted in the computational efficiency of the approach and catalyzed by the demand presented by the big data era. In this paper, we present new developments within the INLA package with the aim to provide a computationally efficient mechanism for the Bayesian inference of relevant challenging situations.","Generalized additive models (GAMs) are flexible non-linear regression models, which can be fitted efficiently using the approximate Bayesian methods provided by the mgcv R package. While the GAM methods provided by mgcv are based on the assumption that the response distribution is modeled parametrically, here we discuss more flexible methods that do not entail any parametric assumption. In particular, this article introduces the qgam package, which is an extension of mgcv providing fast calibrated Bayesian methods for fitting quantile GAMs (QGAMs) in R. QGAMs are based on a smooth version of the pinball loss of Koenker (2005), rather than on a likelihood function, hence jointly achieving satisfactory accuracy of the quantile point estimates and coverage of the corresponding credible intervals requires adopting the specialized Bayesian fitting framework of Fasiolo, Wood, Zaffran, Nedellec, and Goude (2021b). Here we detail how this framework is implemented in qgam and we provide examples illustrating how the package should be used in practice.","Missing data occur in many types of studies and typically complicate the analysis. Multiple imputation, either using joint modeling or the more flexible fully conditional specification approach, are popular and work well in standard settings. In settings involving nonlinear associations or interactions, however, incompatibility of the imputation model with the analysis model is an issue often resulting in bias. Similarly, complex outcomes such as longitudinal or survival outcomes cannot be adequately handled by standard implementations. In this paper, we introduce the R package JointAI, which utilizes the Bayesian framework to perform simultaneous analysis and imputation in regression models with incomplete covariates. Using a fully Bayesian joint modeling approach it overcomes the issue of uncongeniality while retaining the attractive flexibility of fully conditional specification multiple imputation by specifying the joint distribution of analysis and imputation models as a sequence of univariate models that can be adapted to the type of variable. JointAI provides functions for Bayesian inference with generalized linear and generalized linear mixed models and extensions thereof as well as survival models and joint models for longitudinal and survival data, that take arguments analogous to the corresponding well known functions for the analysis of complete data from base R and other packages. Usage and features of JointAI are described and illustrated using various examples and the theoretical background is outlined.","Stochastic volatility (SV) models are nonlinear state-space models that enjoy increasing popularity for fitting and predicting heteroskedastic time series. However, due to the large number of latent quantities, their efficient estimation is non-trivial and software that allows to easily fit SV models to data is rare. We aim to alleviate this issue by presenting novel implementations of five SV models delivered in two R packages. Several unique features are included and documented. As opposed to previous versions, stochvol is now capable of handling linear mean models, conditionally heavy tails, and the leverage effect in combination with SV. Moreover, we newly introduce factorstochvol which caters for multivariate SV. Both packages offer a user-friendly interface through the conventional R generics and a range of tailor-made methods. Computational efficiency is achieved via interfacing R to C++ and doing the heavy work in the latter. In the paper at hand, we provide a detailed discussion on Bayesian SV estimation and showcase the use of the new software through various examples.","There have been considerable methodological developments of Bayes factors for hypothesis testing in the social and behavioral sciences, and related fields. This development is due to the flexibility of the Bayes factor for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, the ability to test complex hypotheses involving equality as well as order constraints on the parameters of interest, and the interpretability of the outcome as the weight of evidence provided by the data in support of competing scientific theories. The available software tools for Bayesian hypothesis testing are still limited however. In this paper we present a new R package called BFpack that contains functions for Bayes factor hypothesis testing for the many common testing problems. The software includes novel tools for (i) Bayesian exploratory testing (e.g., zero vs positive vs negative effects), (ii) Bayesian confirmatory testing (competing hypotheses with equality and/or order constraints), (iii) common statistical analyses, such as linear regression, generalized linear models, (multivariate) analysis of (co)variance, correlation analysis, and random intercept models, (iv) using default priors, and (v) while allowing data to contain missing observations that are missing at random.","Use of historical data in clinical trial design and analysis has shown various advantages such as reduction of number of subjects and increase of study power. The metaanalytic-predictive (MAP) approach accounts with a hierarchical model for between-trial heterogeneity in order to derive an informative prior from historical data. In this paper, we introduce the package RBesT (R Bayesian evidence synthesis tools) which implements the MAP approach with normal (known sampling standard deviation), binomial and Poisson endpoints. The hierarchical MAP model is evaluated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MCMC samples representing the MAP prior are approximated with parametric mixture densities which are obtained with the expectation maximization algorithm. The parametric mixture density representation facilitates easy communication of the MAP prior and enables fast and accurate analytical procedures to evaluate properties of trial designs with informative MAP priors. The paper first introduces the framework of robust Bayesian evidence synthesis in this setting and then explains how RBesT facilitates the derivation and evaluation of an informative MAP prior from historical control data. In addition we describe how the meta-analytic framework relates to further applications including probability of success calculations.","Structural equation models comprise a large class of popular statistical models, including factor analysis models, certain mixed models, and extensions thereof. Model estimation is complicated by the fact that we typically have multiple interdependent response variables and multiple latent variables (which may also be called random effects or hidden variables), often leading to slow and inefficient posterior sampling. In this paper, we describe and illustrate a general, efficient approach to Bayesian SEM estimation in Stan, contrasting it with previous implementations in R package blavaan (Merkle and Rosseel 2018). After describing the approaches in detail, we conduct a practical comparison under multiple scenarios. The comparisons show that the new approach is clearly better. We also discuss ways that the approach may be extended to other models that are of interest to psychometricians.","Vector autoregression (VAR) models are widely used for multivariate time series analysis in macroeconomics, finance, and related fields. Bayesian methods are often employed to deal with their dense parameterization, imposing structure on model coefficients via prior information. The optimal choice of the degree of informativeness implied by these priors is subject of much debate and can be approached via hierarchical modeling. This paper introduces BVAR, an R package dedicated to the estimation of Bayesian VAR models with hierarchical prior selection. It implements functionalities and options that permit addressing a wide range of research problems, while retaining an easy-to-use and transparent interface. Features include structural analysis of impulse responses, forecasts, the most commonly used conjugate priors, as well as a framework for defining custom dummy-observation priors. BVAR makes Bayesian VAR models user-friendly and provides an accessible reference implementation.","In molecular biology, advances in high-throughput technologies have made it possible to study complex multivariate phenotypes and their simultaneous associations with high-dimensional genomic and other omics data, a problem that can be studied with high-dimensional multi-response regression, where the response variables are potentially highly correlated. To this purpose, we recently introduced several multivariate Bayesian variable and covariance selection models, e.g., Bayesian estimation methods for sparse seemingly unrelated regression for variable and covariance selection. Several variable selection priors have been implemented in this context, in particular the hotspot detection prior for latent variable inclusion indicators, which results in sparse variable selection for associations between predictors and multiple phenotypes. We also propose an alternative, which uses a Markov random field (MRF) prior for incorporating prior knowledge about the dependence structure of the inclusion indicators. Inference of Bayesian seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is made computationally feasible by factorization of the covariance matrix amongst the response variables. In this paper we present BayesSUR, an R package, which allows the user to easily specify and run a range of different Bayesian SUR models, which have been implemented in C++ for computational efficiency. The R package allows the specification of the models in a modular way, where the user chooses the priors for variable selection and for covariance selection separately. We demonstrate the performance of sparse SUR models with the hotspot prior and spike-and-slab MRF prior on synthetic and real data sets representing eQTL or mQTL studies and in vitro anti-cancer drug screening studies as examples for typical applications.","BNPmix is an R package for Bayesian nonparametric multivariate density estimation, clustering, and regression, using Pitman-Yor mixture models, a flexible and robust generalization of the popular class of Dirichlet process mixture models. A variety of model specifications and state-of-the-art posterior samplers are implemented. In order to achieve computational efficiency, all sampling methods are written in C++ and seamless integrated into R by means of the Rcpp and RcppArmadillo packages. BNPmix exploits the ggplot2 capabilities and implements a series of generic functions to plot and print summaries of posterior densities and induced clustering of the data.","We introduce the new package dmbc that implements a Bayesian algorithm for clustering a set of binary dissimilarity matrices within a model-based framework. Specifically, we consider the case when S matrices are available, each describing the dissimilarities among the same n objects, possibly expressed by S subjects (judges), or measured under different experimental conditions, or with reference to different characteristics of the objects themselves. In particular, we focus on binary dissimilarities, taking values 0 or 1 depending on whether or not two objects are deemed as dissimilar. We are interested in analyzing such data using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Differently from standard MDS algorithms, our goal is to cluster the dissimilarity matrices and, simultaneously, to extract an MDS configuration specific for each cluster. To this end, we develop a fully Bayesian three-way MDS approach, where the elements of each dissimilarity matrix are modeled as a mixture of Bernoulli random vectors. The parameter estimates and the MDS configurations are derived using a hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We also propose a BIC-like criterion for jointly selecting the optimal number of clusters and latent space dimensions. We illustrate our approach referring both to synthetic data and to a publicly available data set taken from the literature. For the sake of efficiency, the core computations in the package are implemented in C/C++. The package also allows the simulation of multiple chains through the support of the parallel package.","Over the last decades, the challenges in applied regression and in predictive modeling have been changing considerably: (1) More flexible regression model specifications are needed as data sizes and available information are steadily increasing, consequently demanding for more powerful computing infrastructure. (2) Full probabilistic models by means of distributional regression - rather than predicting only some underlying individual quantities from the distributions such as means or expectations - is crucial in many applications. (3) Availability of Bayesian inference has gained in importance both as an appealing framework for regularizing or penalizing complex models and estimation therein as well as a natural alternative to classical frequentist inference. However, while there has been a lot of research on all three challenges and the development of corresponding software packages, a modular software implementation that allows to easily combine all three aspects has not yet been available for the general framework of distributional regression. To fill this gap, the R package bamlss is introduced for Bayesian additive models for location, scale, and shape (and beyond) - with the name reflecting the most important distributional quantities (among others) that can be modeled with the software. At the core of the package are algorithms for highly-efficient Bayesian estimation and inference that can be applied to generalized additive models or generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape, or more general distributional regression models. However, its building blocks are designed as \"Lego bricks\" encompassing various distributions (exponential family, Cox, joint models, etc.), regression terms (linear, splines, random effects, tensor products, spatial fields, etc.), and estimators (MCMC, backfitting, gradient boosting, lasso, etc.). It is demonstrated how these can be easily combined to make classical models more flexible or to create new custom models for specific modeling challenges.","In this summary we introduce the papers published in the special issue on Bayesian statistics. This special issue comprises 20 papers on Bayesian statistics and Bayesian inference on different topics such as general packages for hierarchical linear model fitting, survival models, clinical trials, missing values, time series, hypothesis testing, priors, approximate Bayesian computation, and others.","Density estimation and inference methods are widely used in empirical work. When the underlying distribution has compact support, conventional kernel-based density estimators are no longer consistent near or at the boundary because of their well-known boundary bias. Alternative smoothing methods are available to handle boundary points in density estimation, but they all require additional tuning parameter choices or other typically ad hoc modifications depending on the evaluation point and/or approach considered. This article discusses the R and Stata package lpdensity implementing a novel local polynomial density estimator proposed and studied in Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2020, 2022), which is boundary adaptive and involves only one tuning parameter. The methods implemented also cover local polynomial estimation of the cumulative distribution function and density derivatives. In addition to point estimation and graphical procedures, the package offers consistent variance estimators, mean squared error optimal bandwidth selection, robust bias-corrected inference, and confidence bands construction, among other features. A comparison with other density estimation packages available in R using a Monte Carlo experiment is provided.","Non-regression-based inferences, such as discriminant analysis, can account for the effect of predictor distributions that may be significant in big data modeling. We describe bbl, an R package for Boltzmann Bayes learning, which enables a comprehensive supervised learning of the association between a large number of categorical predictors and multi-level response variables. Its basic underlying statistical model is a collection of (fully visible) Boltzmann machines inferred for each distinct response level. The algorithm reduces to the naive Bayes learner when interaction is ignored. We illustrate example use cases for various scenarios, ranging from modeling of a relatively small set of factors with heterogeneous levels to those with hundreds or more predictors with uniform levels such as image or genomic data. We show how bbl explicitly quantifies the extra power provided by interactions via higher predictive performance of the model. In comparison to deep learning-based methods such as restricted Boltzmann machines, bbl-trained models can be interpreted directly via their bias and interaction parameters.","This paper introduces the R package FKSUM, which offers fast and exact evaluation of univariate kernel smoothers. The main kernel computations are implemented in C++, and are wrapped in simple, intuitive and versatile R functions. The fast kernel computations are based on recursive expressions involving the order statistics, which allows for exact evaluation of kernel smoothers at all sample points in log-linear time. In addition to general purpose kernel smoothing functions, the package offers purpose built and readyto-use implementations of popular kernel-type estimators. On top of these basic smoothing problems, this paper focuses on projection pursuit problems in which the projection index is based on kernel-type estimators of functionals of the projected density.","The poolr package provides an implementation of a variety of methods for pooling (i.e., combining) p values, including Fisher's method, Stouffer's method, the inverse chisquare method, the binomial test, the Bonferroni method, and Tippett's method. More importantly, the methods can be adjusted to account for dependence among the tests from which the p values have been derived assuming multivariate normality among the test statistics. All methods can be adjusted based on an estimate of the effective number of tests or by using an empirically-derived null distribution based on pseudo replicates that mimics a proper permutation test. For the Fisher, Stouffer, and inverse chi-square methods, the test statistics can also be directly generalized to account for dependence, leading to Brown's method, Strube's method, and the generalized inverse chi-square method. In this paper, we describe the various methods, discuss their implementation in the package, illustrate their use based on several examples, and compare the poolr package with several other packages that can be used to combine p values.","This paper introduces the usage and performance of the R package tlrmvnmvt, aimed at computing high-dimensional multivariate normal and Student-t probabilities. The package implements the tile-low-rank methods with block reordering and the separationof-variable methods with univariate reordering. The performance is compared with two other state-of-the-art R packages, namely the mvtnorm and the TruncatedNormal packages. Our package has the best scalability and is likely to be the only option in thousands of dimensions. However, for applications with high accuracy requirements, the TruncatedNormal package is more suitable. As an application example, we show that the excursion sets of a latent Gaussian random field can be computed with the tlrmvnmvt package without any model approximation and hence, the accuracy of the produced excursion sets is improved.","Like many groups considering the new programming language Julia, we faced the challenge of accessing the algorithms that we develop in Julia from R. Therefore, we developed the R package JuliaConnectoR, available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), the official R package repository, and from GitHub (https://github. com/stefan-m-lenz/JuliaConnectoR), in particular for making advanced deep learning tools available. For maintainability and stability, we decided to base communication between R and Julia on the transmission control protocol, using an optimized binary format for exchanging data. Our package also specifically contains features that allow for a convenient interactive use in R. This makes it easy to develop R extensions with Julia or to simply call functionality from Julia packages in R. Interacting with Julia objects and calling Julia functions becomes user-friendly, as Julia functions and variables are made directly available as objects in the R workspace. We illustrate the further features of our package with code examples, and also discuss advantages over the two alternative packages JuliaCall and XRJulia. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the package with a more extensive example for employing neural ordinary differential equations, a recent deep learning technique that has received much attention. This example also provides more general guidance for integrating deep learning techniques from Julia into R.","We describe a new algorithm and R package for peak detection in genomic data sets using constrained changepoint models. These detect changes from background to peak regions by imposing the constraint that the mean should alternately increase then decrease. An existing algorithm for this problem exists, and gives state-of-the-art accuracy results, but it is computationally expensive when the number of changes is large. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm that jointly estimates the number of peaks and their locations by minimizing a cost function which consists of a data fitting term and a penalty for each changepoint. Empirically this algorithm has a cost that is O(N log(N )) for analyzing data of length N . We also propose a sequential search algorithm that finds the best solution with K segments in O(log(K) N log(N )) time, which is much faster than the previous O(K N log(N )) algorithm. We show that our disk-based implementation in the PeakSegDisk R package can be used to quickly compute constrained optimal models with many changepoints, which are needed to analyze typical genomic data sets that have tens of millions of observations.","Linear transformation models, including the proportional hazards model and proportional odds model, under right censoring were discussed by Chen, Jin, and Ying (2002). The asymptotic variance of the estimator they proposed has a closed form and can be obtained easily by plug-in rules, which improves the computational efficiency. We develop an R package TransModel based on Chen's approach. The detailed usage of the package is discussed, and the function is applied to the Veterans' Administration lung cancer data.","Bayesian synthetic likelihood (BSL; Price, Drovandi, Lee, and Nott 2018) is a popular method for estimating the parameter posterior distribution for complex statistical models and stochastic processes that possess a computationally intractable likelihood function. Instead of evaluating the likelihood, BSL approximates the likelihood of a judiciously chosen summary statistic of the data via model simulation and density estimation. Compared to alternative methods such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), BSL requires little tuning and requires less model simulations than ABC when the chosen summary statistic is high-dimensional. The original synthetic likelihood relies on a multivariate normal approximation of the intractable likelihood, where the mean and covariance are estimated by simulation. An extension of BSL considers replacing the sample covariance with a penalized covariance estimator to reduce the number of required model simulations. Further, a semi-parametric approach has been developed to relax the normality assumption. Finally, another extension of BSL aims to develop a more robust synthetic likelihood estimator while acknowledging there might be model misspecification. In this paper, we present the R package BSL that amalgamates the aforementioned methods and more into a single, easy-to-use and coherent piece of software. The package also includes several examples to illustrate use of the package and the utility of the methods.","The stochastic block model is a popular probabilistic model for random graphs. It is commonly used to cluster network data by aggregating nodes that share similar connectivity patterns into blocks. When fitting a stochastic block model to a partially observed network, it is important to consider the underlying process that generates the missing values, otherwise the inference may be biased. This paper presents missSBM, an R package that fits stochastic block models when the network is partially observed, i.e., the adjacency matrix contains not only 1s or 0s encoding the presence or absence of edges, but also NAs encoding the missing information between pairs of nodes. This package implements a set of algorithms to adjust the binary stochastic block model, possibly in the presence of external covariates, by performing variational inference suitable for several observation processes. Our implementation automatically explores different block numbers to select the most relevant model according to the integrated classification likelihood criterion. The integrated classification likelihood criterion can also help determine which observation process best fits a given dataset. Finally, missSBM can be used to perform imputation of missing entries in the adjacency matrix. We illustrate the package on a network dataset consisting of interactions between political blogs sampled during the 2007 French presidential election.","Markov random fields on two-dimensional lattices are behind many image analysis methodologies. mrf2d provides tools for statistical inference on a class of discrete stationary Markov random field models with pairwise interaction, which includes many of the popular models such as the Potts model and texture image models. The package introduces representations of dependence structures and parameters, visualization functions and efficient (C++-based) implementations of sampling algorithms, common estimation methods and other key features of the model, providing a useful framework to implement algorithms and working with the model in general. This paper presents a description and details of the package, as well as some reproducible examples of usage.","This paper presents the tidypaleo package for R, which enables high-quality reproducible visualizations of time-stratigraphic multivariate data that is common to several disciplines of the natural sciences. Rather than introduce new plotting functions, the tidypaleo package defines several orthogonal components of the ggplot2 package that, when combined, enable most types of stratigraphic diagrams to be created. We do so by conceptualizing multi-parameter data as a series of measurements (rows) with attributes (columns), enabling the use of the ggplot2 facet mechanism to display multi-parameter data. The orthogonal components include (1) scales that represent relative abundance and concentration values, (2) geometries that are commonly used in paleoenvironmental diagrams created elsewhere, (3) facets that correctly assign scales and sizes to panels representing multiple parameters, and (4) theme elements that enable tidypaleo to create elegant graphics. Collectively, this approach demonstrates the efficacy of a minimal ggplot2 wrapper to create domain-specific plots.","The R package econet provides methods for estimating parameter-dependent network centrality measures with linear-in-means models. Both nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood estimators are implemented. The methods allow for both link and node heterogeneity in network effects, endogenous network formation and the presence of unconnected nodes. The routines also compare the explanatory power of parameter-dependent network centrality measures with those of standard measures of network centrality. Benefits and features of the econet package are illustrated using data from Battaglini and Patacchini (2018) and Battaglini, Leone Sciabolazza, and Patacchini (2020).","Gaussian processes are a class of flexible nonparametric Bayesian tools that are widely used across the sciences, and in industry, to model complex data sources. Key to applying Gaussian process models is the availability of well-developed open source software, which is available in many programming languages. In this paper, we present a tutorial of the GaussianProcesses.jl package that has been developed for the Julia programming language. GaussianProcesses.jl utilizes the inherent computational benefits of the Julia language, including multiple dispatch and just-in-time compilation, to produce a fast, flexible and user-friendly Gaussian processes package. The package provides many mean and kernel functions with supporting inference tools to fit exact Gaussian process models, as well as a range of alternative likelihood functions to handle non-Gaussian data (e.g., binary classification models) and sparse approximations for scalable Gaussian processes. The package makes efficient use of existing Julia packages to provide users with a range of optimization and plotting tools.","This article presents the NeuralSens package that can be used to perform sensitivity analysis of neural networks using the partial derivatives method. The main function of the package calculates the partial derivatives of the output with regard to the input variables of a multi-layer perceptron model, which can be used to evaluate variable importance based on sensitivity measures and characterize relationships between input and output variables. Methods to calculate partial derivatives are provided for objects trained using common neural network packages in R, and a 'numeric' method is provided for objects from packages which are not included. The package also includes functions to plot the information obtained from the sensitivity analysis. The article contains an overview of techniques for obtaining information from neural network models, a theoretical foundation of how partial derivatives are calculated, a description of the package functions, and applied examples to compare NeuralSens functions with analogous functions from other available R packages.","stagedtrees is an R package which includes several algorithms for learning the structure of staged trees and chain event graphs from data. Score-based and clustering-based algorithms are implemented, as well as various functionalities to plot the models and perform inference. The capabilities of stagedtrees are illustrated using mainly two datasets both included in the package or bundled in R.","We present the features and implementation of the R package nvmix for the class of normal variance mixtures including Student t and normal distributions. The package provides functionalities for such distributions, notably the evaluation of the distribution and density function as well as likelihood-based parameter estimation. The distributional family is specified through the quantile function of the underlying mixing random variable. The R package nvmix thus allows one to model multivariate distributions well beyond the classical multivariate normal and t case. Additional functionalities include graphical goodness-of-fit assessment, the estimation of the risk measures value-at-risk and expected shortfall for univariate normal variance mixture distributions and functions to work with normal variance mixture copulas, such as sampling and the evaluation of normal variance mixture copulas and their densities. Furthermore, the package nvmix also provides functionalities for the evaluation of the distribution and density function as well as random variate generation for the more general class of grouped normal variance mixtures.","The R package sensobol provides several functions to conduct variance-based uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, from the estimation of sensitivity indices to the visual representation of the results. It implements several state-of-the-art first and total-order estimators and allows the computation of up to fourth-order effects, as well as of the approximation error, in a swift and user-friendly way. Its flexibility makes it also appropriate for models with either a scalar or a multivariate output. We illustrate its functionality by conducting a variance-based sensitivity analysis of three classic models: the Sobol' (1998) G function, the logistic population growth model of Verhulst (1845), and the spruce budworm and forest model of Ludwig, Jones, and Holling (1976).","In factor analysis and structural equation modeling non-normal data simulation is traditionally performed by specifying univariate skewness and kurtosis together with the target covariance matrix. However, this leaves little control over the univariate distributions and the multivariate copula of the simulated vector. In this paper we explain how a more flexible simulation method called vine-to-anything (VITA) may be obtained from copula-based techniques, as implemented in a new R package, covsim. VITA is based on the concept of a regular vine, where bivariate copulas are coupled together into a full multivariate copula. We illustrate how to simulate continuous and ordinal data for covariance modeling, and how to use the new package discnorm to test for underlying normality in ordinal data. An introduction to copula and vine simulation is provided in the appendix.","Due to tradition and ease of estimation, the vast majority of clinical and epidemiological papers with time-to-event data report hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazards regression models. Although hazard ratios are well known, they can be difficult to interpret, particularly as causal contrasts, in many settings. Nonparametric or fully parametric estimators allow for the direct estimation of more easily causally interpretable estimands such as the cumulative incidence and restricted mean survival. However, modeling these quantities as functions of covariates is limited to a few categorical covariates with nonparametric estimators, and often requires simulation or numeric integration with parametric estimators. Combining pseudo-observations based on non-parametric estimands with parametric regression on the pseudo-observations allows for the best of these two approaches and has many nice properties. In this paper, we develop a user friendly, easy to understand way of doing event history regression for the cumulative incidence and the restricted mean survival, using the pseudo-observation framework for estimation. The interface uses the well known formulation of a generalized linear model and allows for features including plotting of residuals, the use of sampling weights, and correct variance estimation.","The smacof package offers a comprehensive implementation of multidimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in R. Since its first publication (De Leeuw and Mair 2009b) the functionality of the package has been enhanced, and several additional methods, features and utilities were added. Major updates include a complete re-implementation of multidimensional unfolding allowing for monotone dissimilarity transformations, including row-conditional, circular, and external unfolding. Additionally, the constrained MDS implementation was extended in terms of optimal scaling of the external variables. Further package additions include various tools and functions for goodness-of-fit assessment, unidimensional scaling, gravity MDS, asymmetric MDS, Procrustes, and MDS biplots. All these new package functionalities are illustrated using a variety of real-life applications.","The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility datasets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records, and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These datasets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical \"laws\" that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. A view on state-of-the-art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. In this paper, we propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is efficient and easy to use as it extends pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic data, from analyzing statistical patterns to assessing the privacy risk related to the analysis of mobility datasets.","This article introduces the R package evgam. The package provides functions for fitting extreme value distributions. These include the generalized extreme value and generalized Pareto distributions. The former can also be fitted through a point process representation. Package evgam supports quantile regression via the asymmetric Laplace distribution, which can be useful for estimating high thresholds, sometimes used to discriminate between extreme and non-extreme values. The main addition of package evgam is to let extreme value distribution parameters have generalized additive model forms, the smoothness of which can be objectively estimated using Laplace's method. Illustrative examples fitting various distributions with various specifications are given. These include daily precipitation accumulations for part of Colorado, US, used to illustrate spatial models, and daily maximum temperatures for Fort Collins, Colorado, US, used to illustrate temporal models.","Effective processing of character strings is required at various stages of data analysis pipelines: from data cleansing and preparation, through information extraction, to report generation. Pattern searching, string collation and sorting, normalization, transliteration, and formatting are ubiquitous in text mining, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. This paper discusses and demonstrates how and why stringi, a mature R package for fast and portable handling of string data based on ICU (International Components for Unicode), should be included in each statistician's or data scientist's repertoire to complement their numerical computing and data wrangling skills.","modelsummary is a package to summarize data and statistical models in R. It supports over one hundred types of models out-of-the-box, and allows users to report the results of those models side-by-side in a table, or in coefficient plots. It makes it easy to execute common tasks such as computing robust standard errors, adding significance stars, and manipulating coefficient and model labels. Beyond model summaries, the package also includes a suite of tools to produce highly flexible data summary tables, such as dataset overviews, correlation matrices, (multi-level) cross-tabulations, and balance tables (also known as \"Table 1\"). The appearance of the tables produced by modelsummary can be customized using external packages such as kableExtra, gt, flextable, or huxtable; the plots can be customized using ggplot2. Tables can be exported to many output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, Text/Markdown, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, Excel, RTF, PDF, and image files. Tables and plots can be embedded seamlessly in rmarkdown, knitr, or Sweave dynamic documents. The modelsummary package is designed to be simple, robust, modular, and extensible.","Actuaries model insurance claim amounts using heavy tailed probability distributions. They routinely need to evaluate quantities related to these distributions such as quantiles in the far right tail, moments or limited moments. Furthermore, actuaries often resort to simulation to solve otherwise untractable risk evaluation problems. The paper discusses our implementation of support functions for the Feller-Pareto distribution for the R package actuar. The Feller-Pareto defines a large family of heavy tailed distributions encompassing the transformed beta family and many variants of the Pareto distribution.","Reproducible document standards, like R Markdown, facilitate the programmatic creation of documents whose content is itself programmatically generated. While programmatic content alone may not be sufficient for a rendered document since it does not include prose (content generated by an author to provide context, a narrative, etc.) programmatic generation can provide substantial efficiencies for structuring and constructing documents. This paper explores the programmatic generation of reproducible documents by distinguishing components that can be created by computational means from those requiring human-generation, providing guidelines for the generation of these documents, and identifying a use case in clinical trial reporting. These concepts and use case are illustrated through the listdown package for the R programming environment, which is is currently available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network.","The popularity of Bayesian statistical methods has increased dramatically in recent years across many research areas and industrial applications. This is the result of a variety of methodological advances with faster and cheaper hardware as well as the development of new software tools. Here we introduce an open source Python package named Bambi (BAyesian Model Building Interface) that is built on top of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework and the ArviZ package for exploratory analysis of Bayesian models. Bambi makes it easy to specify complex generalized linear hierarchical models using a formula notation similar to those found in R. We demonstrate Bambi's versatility and ease of use with a few examples spanning a range of common statistical models including multiple regression, logistic regression, and mixed-effects modeling with crossed group specific effects. Additionally we discuss how automatic priors are constructed. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of our plans for the future development of Bambi.","The article and accompanying software package have been retracted by the authors, and hence removed from the journal, because the software violated the copyright of a proprietary software and the intellectual property of a third party.","UComp is a powerful library for building unobserved components models, useful for forecasting and other important operations, such us de-trending, cycle analysis, seasonal adjustment, signal extraction, etc. One of the most outstanding features that makes UComp unique among its class of related software implementations is that models may be built automatically by identification algorithms (three versions are available). These algorithms select the best model among many possible combinations. Another relevant feature is that it is coded in C++, opening the door to link it to different popular and widely used environments, like R, MATLAB, Octave, Python, etc. The implemented models for the components are more general than the usual ones in the field of unobserved components modeling, including different types of trend, cycle, seasonal and irregular components, input variables and outlier detection. The automatic character of the algorithms required the development of many complementary algorithms to control performance and make it applicable to as many different time series as possible. The library is open source and available in different formats in public repositories. The performance of the library is illustrated working on real data in several varied examples.","Mediation analysis is one of the most widely used statistical techniques in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Mediation models allow to study how an independent variable affects a dependent variable indirectly through one or more intervening variables, which are called mediators. The analysis is often carried out via a series of linear regressions, in which case the indirect effects can be computed as products of coefficients from those regressions. Statistical significance of the indirect effects is typically assessed via a bootstrap test based on ordinary least-squares estimates. However, this test is sensitive to outliers or other deviations from normality assumptions, which poses a serious threat to empirical testing of theory about mediation mechanisms. The R package robmed implements a robust procedure for mediation analysis based on the fast-and-robust bootstrap methodology for robust regression estimators, which yields reliable results even when the data deviate from the usual normality assumptions. Various other procedures for mediation analysis are included in package robmed as well. Moreover, robmed introduces a new formula interface that allows to specify mediation models with a single formula, and provides various plots for diagnostics or visual representation of the results.","Consider a Bayesian inference problem where a variable of interest does not take values in a Euclidean space. These \"non-standard\" data structures are in reality fairly common. They are frequently used in problems involving latent discrete factor models, networks, and domain specific problems such as sequence alignments and reconstructions, pedigrees, and phylogenies. In principle, Bayesian inference should be particularly wellsuited in such scenarios, as the Bayesian paradigm provides a principled way to obtain confidence assessment for random variables of any type. However, much of the recent work on making Bayesian analysis more accessible and computationally efficient has focused on inference in Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we introduce Blang, a domain specific language and library aimed at bridging this gap. Blang allows users to perform Bayesian analysis on arbitrary data types while using a declarative syntax similar to the popular family of probabilistic programming languages, BUGS. Blang is augmented with intuitive language additions to create data types of the user's choosing. To perform inference at scale on such arbitrary state spaces, Blang leverages recent advances in sequential Monte Carlo and non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.","This article presents a new implementation of hierarchical clustering for the R language that allows one to apply spatial or temporal contiguity constraints during the clustering process. The need for contiguity constraint arises, for instance, when one wants to partition a map into different domains of similar physical conditions, identify discontinuities in time series, group regional administrative units with respect to their performance, and so on. To increase computation efficiency, we programmed the core functions in plain C. The result is a new R function, constr.hclust, which is distributed in package adespatial. The program implements the general agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm described by Lance and Williams (1966; 1967), with the particularity of allowing only clusters that are contiguous in geographic space or along time to fuse at any given step. Contiguity can be defined with respect to space or time. Information about spatial contiguity is provided by a connection network among sites, with edges describing the links between connected sites. Clustering with a temporal contiguity constraint is also known as chronological clustering. Information on temporal contiguity can be implicitly provided as the rank positions of observations in the time series. The implementation was mirrored on that found in the hierarchical clustering function hclust of the standard R package stats (R Core Team 2022). We transcribed that function from Fortran to C and added the functionality to apply constraints when running the function. The implementation is efficient. It is limited mainly by input/output access as massive amounts of memory are potentially needed to store copies of the dissimilarity matrix and update its elements when analyzing large problems. We provided R computer code for plotting results for numbers of clusters.","Recent advances in computational methods for intractable models have made network data increasingly amenable to statistical analysis. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) emerged as one of the main families of models capable of capturing the complex dependence structure of network data in a wide range of applied contexts. The Bergm package for R has become a popular package to carry out Bayesian parameter inference, missing data imputation, model selection and goodness-of-fit diagnostics for ERGMs. Over the last few years, the package has been considerably improved in terms of efficiency by adopting some of the state-of-the-art Bayesian computational methods for doublyintractable distributions. Recently, version 5 of the package has been made available on CRAN having undergone a substantial makeover, which has made it more accessible and easy to use for practitioners. New functions include data augmentation procedures based on the approximate exchange algorithm for dealing with missing data, adjusted pseudolikelihood and pseudo-posterior procedures, which allow for fast approximate inference of the ERGM parameter posterior and model evidence for networks on several thousands nodes.","Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat to global health. Evidence for this trend is generated in microbiological laboratories through testing microorganisms for resistance against antimicrobial agents. International standards and guidelines are in place for this process as well as for reporting data on (inter-)national levels. However, there is a gap in the availability of standardized and reproducible tools for working with laboratory data to produce the required reports. It is known that extensive efforts in data cleaning and validation are required when working with data from laboratory information systems. Furthermore, the global spread and relevance of antimicrobial resistance demands to incorporate international reference data in the analysis process. In this paper, we introduce the AMR package for R that aims at closing this gap by providing tools to simplify antimicrobial resistance data cleaning and analysis, while incorporating international guidelines and scientifically reliable reference data. The AMR package enables standardized and reproducible antimicrobial resistance analyses, including the application of evidence-based rules, determination of first isolates, translation of various codes for microorganisms and antimicrobial agents, determination of (multi-drug) resistant microorganisms, and calculation of antimicrobial resistance, prevalence and future trends. The AMR package works independently of any laboratory information system and provides several functions to integrate into international workflows (e.g., WHONET software provided by the World Health Organization).","We introduce Pathogen.jl for simulation and inference of transmission network individual level models (TN-ILMs) of infectious disease spread in continuous time. TN-ILMs can be used to jointly infer transmission networks, event times, and model parameters within a Bayesian framework via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We detail our specific strategies for conducting MCMC for TN-ILMs, and our implementation of these strategies in the Julia package, Pathogen.jl, which leverages key features of the Julia language. We provide an example using Pathogen.jl to simulate an epidemic following a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) TN-ILM, and then perform inference using observations that were generated from that epidemic. We also demonstrate the functionality of Pathogen.jl with an application of TN-ILMs to data from a measles outbreak that occurred in Hagelloch, Germany, in 1861 (Pfeilsticker 1863; Oesterle 1992).","This paper describes the gretl function package ParMA, which provides Bayesian model averaging (BMA) in generalized linear models. In order to overcome the lack of analytical specification for many of the models covered, the package features an implementation of the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, following the original idea by Green (1995), as a flexible tool to model several specifications. Particular attention is devoted to computational aspects such as the automatization of the model building procedure and the parallelization of the sampling scheme.","The R package calculus implements C++-optimized functions for numerical and symbolic calculus, such as the Einstein summing convention, fast computation of the LeviCivita symbol and generalized Kronecker delta, Taylor series expansion, multivariate Hermite polynomials, high-order derivatives, ordinary differential equations, differential operators and numerical integration in arbitrary orthogonal coordinate systems. The library applies numerical methods when working with functions, or symbolic programming when working with characters or expressions. The package handles multivariate numerical calculus in arbitrary dimensions and coordinates. It implements the symbolic counterpart of the numerical methods whenever possible, without depending on external computer algebra systems. Except for Rcpp, the package has no strict dependencies in order to provide a stable self-contained toolbox that invites re-use.","A large body of research has focused on theory and computation for variable selection techniques for high dimensional data. There has been substantially less work in the big \"tall\" data paradigm, where the number of variables may be large, but the number of observations is much larger. The orthogonalizing expectation maximization (OEM) algorithm is one approach for computation of penalized models which excels in the big tall data regime. The oem package is an efficient implementation of the OEM algorithm which provides a multitude of computation routines with a focus on big tall data, such as a function for out-of-memory computation, for large-scale parallel computation of penalized regression models. Furthermore, in this paper we propose a specialized implementation of the OEM algorithm for cross validation, dramatically reducing the computing time for cross validation over a naive implementation.","synthACS is an R package that provides flexible tools for building synthetic microdatasets based on American Community Survey (ACS) base tables, allows data-extensibility and enables to conduct spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM) via simulated annealing. To our knowledge, it is the first R package to provide broadly applicable tools for SMSM with ACS data as well as the first SMSM implementation that uses unequal probability sampling in the simulated annealing algorithm. In this paper, we contextualize these developments within the SMSM literature, provide a hands-on user-guide to package synthACS, present a case study of SMSM related to population dynamics, and note areas for future research.","This document introduces the R package BGVAR to estimate Bayesian global vector autoregressions (GVAR) with shrinkage priors and stochastic volatility. The Bayesian treatment of GVARs allows to include large information sets by mitigating issues related to overfitting. This often improves inference as well as out-of-sample forecasts. Computational efficiency is achieved by using C++ to considerably speed up time-consuming functions. To maximize usability, the package includes numerous functions for carrying out structural inference and forecasting. These include generalized and structural impulse response functions, forecast error variance, and historical decompositions as well as conditional forecasts.","The highfrequency package for the R programming language provides functionality for pre-processing financial high-frequency data, analyzing intraday stock returns, and forecasting stock market volatility. For academics and practitioners alike, it provides a tool chain required to work with such datasets and to conduct statistical analyses dedicated to spot volatility, jumps, realized measures, and many more. We showcase our implemented routines and models on raw high-frequency data from large stock exchanges.","Spatial seemingly unrelated regression (spatial SUR) models are a useful multiequational econometric specification to simultaneously incorporate spatial effects and correlated error terms across equations. The purpose of the spsur R package is to supply a complete set of functions to test for spatial structures in the residual of a SUR model; to estimate the most popular specifications by applying different methods and test for linear restrictions on the parameters. The package also facilitates the estimation of socalled spatial impacts, conveniently adapted to a SUR framework. The package includes functions to simulate datasets with the features decided by the user, which may be useful in teaching activities or in more general research projects. The article concludes with a real data application showing the potential that spsur has to examine the relation of individual mobility over geographic areas and the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain during the first lockdown.","The use of mixed frequency data is now common in many applications, ranging from the analysis of high frequency financial time series to large cross-sections of macroeconomic time series. In this article, we show how state space methods can easily facilitate both estimation and inference in these settings. After presenting a unified treatment of the state space approach to mixed frequency data modeling, we provide a series of applications to demonstrate how our MATLAB toolbox can make the estimation and post-processing of these models straightforward.","We introduce a Python library, called jumpdiff, which includes all necessary functions to assess jump-diffusion processes. This library includes functions which compute a set of non-parametric estimators of all contributions composing a jump-diffusion process, namely the drift, the diffusion, and the stochastic jump strengths. Having a set of measurements from a jump-diffusion process, jumpdiff is able to retrieve the evolution equation producing data series statistically equivalent to the series of measurements. The back-end calculations are based on second-order corrections of the conditional moments expressed from the series of Kramers-Moyal coefficients. Additionally, the library is also able to test if stochastic jump contributions are present in the dynamics underlying a set of measurements. Finally, we introduce a simple iterative method for deriving secondorder corrections of any Kramers-Moyal coefficient.","In this paper we describe the implementation of semi-structured deep distributional regression, a flexible framework to learn conditional distributions based on the combination of additive regression models and deep networks. Our implementation encompasses (1) a modular neural network building system based on the deep learning library TensorFlow for the fusion of various statistical and deep learning approaches, (2) an orthogonalization cell to allow for an interpretable combination of different subnetworks, as well as (3) pre-processing steps necessary to set up such models. The software package allows to define models in a user-friendly manner via a formula interface that is inspired by classical statistical model frameworks such as mgcv. The package's modular design and functionality provides a unique resource for both scalable estimation of complex statistical models and the combination of approaches from deep learning and statistics. This allows for state-of-the-art predictive performance while simultaneously retaining the indispensable interpretability of classical statistical models.","spsurvey is an R package for design-based statistical inference, with a focus on spatial data. spsurvey provides the generalized random-tessellation stratified (GRTS) algorithm to select spatially balanced samples via the grts() function. The grts() function flexibly accommodates several sampling design features, including stratification, varying inclusion probabilities, legacy (or historical) sites, minimum distances between sites, and two options for replacement sites. spsurvey also provides a suite of data analysis options, including categorical variable analysis (cat_analysis()), continuous variable analysis (cont_analysis()), relative risk analysis (relrisk_analysis()), attributable risk analysis (attrisk_analysis()), difference in risk analysis (diffrisk_analysis()), change analysis (change_analysis()), and trend analysis (trend_analysis()). In this manuscript, we first provide background for the GRTS algorithm and the analysis approaches and then show how to implement them in spsurvey. We find that the spatially balanced GRTS algorithm yields more precise parameter estimates than simple random sampling, which ignores spatial information.","The ergm package supports the statistical analysis and simulation of network data. It anchors the statnet suite of packages for network analysis in R introduced in a special issue in Journal of Statistical Software in 2008. This article provides an overview of the new functionality in the 2021 release of ergm version 4. These include more flexible handling of nodal covariates, term operators that extend and simplify model specification, new models for networks with valued edges, improved handling of constraints on the sample space of networks, and estimation with missing edge data. We also identify the new packages in the statnet suite that extend ergm's functionality to other network data types and structural features and the robust set of online resources that support the statnet development process and applications.","The R package abn is designed to fit additive Bayesian network models to observational datasets and contains routines to score Bayesian networks based on Bayesian or information theoretic formulations of generalized linear models. It is equipped with exact search and greedy search algorithms to select the best network, and supports continuous, discrete and count data in the same model and input of prior knowledge at a structural level. The Bayesian implementation supports random effects to control for one-layer clustering. In this paper, we give an overview of the methodology and illustrate the package's functionality using a veterinary dataset concerned with respiratory diseases in commercial swine production.","The R package BiDAG implements Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for structure learning and sampling of Bayesian networks. The package includes tools to search for a maximum a posteriori (MAP) graph and to sample graphs from the posterior distribution given the data. A new hybrid approach to structure learning enables inference in large graphs. In the first step, we define a reduced search space by means of the PC algorithm or based on prior knowledge. In the second step, an iterative order MCMC scheme proceeds to optimize the restricted search space and estimate the MAP graph. Sampling from the posterior distribution is implemented using either order or partition MCMC. The models and algorithms can handle both discrete and continuous data. The BiDAG package also provides an implementation of MCMC schemes for structure learning and sampling of dynamic Bayesian networks.","Recurrent event analyses have found a wide range of applications in biomedicine, public health, and engineering, among others, where study subjects may experience a sequence of event of interest during follow-up. The R package reReg offers a comprehensive collection of practical and easy-to-use tools for regression analysis of recurrent events, possibly with the presence of an informative terminal event. The regression framework is a general scalechange model which encompasses the popular Cox-type model, the accelerated rate model, and the accelerated mean model as special cases. Informative censoring is accommodated through a subject-specific frailty without any need for parametric specification. Different regression models are allowed for the recurrent event process and the terminal event. Also included are visualization and simulation tools.","Despite the large body of research on missing value distributions and imputation, there is comparatively little literature with a focus on how to make it easy to handle, explore, and impute missing values in data. This paper addresses this gap. The new methodology builds upon tidy data principles, with the goal of integrating missing value handling as a key part of data analysis workflows. We define a new data structure, and a suite of new operations. Together, these provide a connected framework for handling, exploring, and imputing missing values. These methods are available in the R package naniar.","This paper introduces the logitr R package for fast maximum likelihood estimation of multinomial logit and mixed logit models with unobserved heterogeneity across individuals, which is modeled by allowing parameters to vary randomly over individuals according to a chosen distribution. The package is faster than other similar packages such as mlogit, gmnl, mixl, and apollo, and it supports utility models specified with &ldquo;preference space&rdquo; or &ldquo;willingness-to-pay (WTP) space&rdquo; parameterizations, allowing for the direct estimation of marginal WTP. The typical procedure of computing WTP post-estimation using a preference space model can lead to unreasonable distributions of WTP across the population in mixed logit models. The paper provides a discussion of some of the implications of each utility parameterization for WTP estimates. It also highlights some of the design features that enable logitr's performant estimation speed and includes a benchmarking exercise with similar packages. Finally, the paper highlights additional features that are designed specifically for WTP space models, including a consistent user interface for specifying models in either space and a parallelized multi-start optimization loop, which is particularly useful for searching the solution space for different local minima when estimating models with non-convex log-likelihood functions.","The R package MLGL, standing for multi-layer group-Lasso, implements a new procedure of variable selection in the context of redundancy between explanatory variables, which holds true with high-dimensional data. A sparsity assumption is made that postulates that only a few variables are relevant for predicting the response variable. In this context, the performance of classical Lasso-based approaches strongly deteriorates as the redundancy increases. The proposed approach combines variables aggregation and selection in order to improve interpretability and performance. First, a hierarchical clustering procedure provides at each level a partition of the variables into groups. Then, the set of groups of variables from the different levels of the hierarchy is given as input to group-Lasso, with weights adapted to the structure of the hierarchy. At this step, group-Lasso outputs sets of candidate groups of variables for each value of the regularization parameter. The versatility offered by package MLGL to choose groups at different levels of the hierarchy a priori induces a high computational complexity. MLGL, however, exploits the structure of the hierarchy and the weights used in group-Lasso to greatly reduce the final time cost. The final choice of the regularization parameter - and therefore the final choice of groups - is made by a multiple hierarchical testing procedure.","The lasso and elastic net are popular regularized regression models for supervised learning. Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2010) introduced a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the elastic net regularization path for ordinary least squares regression, logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression, while Simon, Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2011) extended this work to Cox models for right-censored data. We further extend the reach of the elastic net-regularized regression to all generalized linear model families, Cox models with (start, stop] data and strata, and a simplified version of the relaxed lasso. We also discuss convenient utility functions for measuring the performance of these fitted models.","Analysis of dose-response data is an important step in many scientific disciplines, including but not limited to pharmacology, toxicology, and epidemiology. The R package drda is designed to facilitate the analysis of dose-response data by implementing efficient and accurate functions with a familiar interface. With drda it is possible to fit models by the method of least squares, perform goodness-of-fit tests, and conduct model selection. Compared to other similar packages, drda provides in general more accurate estimates in the least-squares sense. This result is achieved by a smart choice of the starting point in the optimization algorithm and by implementing the Newton method with a trust region with analytical gradients and Hessian matrices. In this article, drda is presented through the description of its methodological components and examples of its user-friendly functions. Performance is evaluated using both synthetic data and a real, large-scale drug sensitivity screening dataset.","Network meta-analysis compares different interventions for the same condition, by combining direct and indirect evidence derived from all eligible studies. Network metaanalysis has been increasingly used by applied scientists and it is a major research topic for methodologists. This article describes the R package netmeta, which adopts frequentist methods to fit network meta-analysis models. We provide a roadmap to perform network meta-analysis, along with an overview of the main functions of the package. We present three worked examples considering different types of outcomes and different data formats to facilitate researchers aiming to conduct network meta-analysis with netmeta.","Many longitudinal studies collect data that have irregular observation times, often requiring the application of linear mixed models with time-varying outcomes. This paper presents an alternative that splits the quantitative analysis into two steps. The first step converts irregularly observed data into a set of repeated measures through the broken stick model. The second step estimates the parameters of scientific interest from the repeated measurements at the subject level. The broken stick model approximates each subject's trajectory by a series of connected straight lines. The breakpoints, specified by the user, divide the time axis into consecutive intervals common to all subjects. Specification of the model requires just three variables: time, measurement and subject. The model is a special case of the linear mixed model, with time as a linear B-spline and subject as the grouping factor. The main assumptions are: Subjects are exchangeable, trajectories between consecutive breakpoints are straight, random effects follow a multivariate normal distribution, and unobserved data are missing at random. The R package brokenstick v2.5.0 offers tools to calculate, predict, impute and visualize broken stick estimates. The package supports two optimization methods, including options to constrain the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects. We demonstrate six applications of the model: Detection of critical periods, estimation of the time-to-time correlations, profile analysis, curve interpolation, multiple imputation and personalized prediction of future outcomes by curve matching.","The study of non-stationary behavior in the extremes is important to analyze data in environmental sciences, climate, finance, or sports. As an alternative to the classical extreme value theory, this analysis can be based on the study of record-breaking events. The R package RecordTest provides a useful framework for non-parametric analysis of non-stationary behavior in the extremes, based on the analysis of records. The underlying idea of all the non-parametric tools implemented in the package is to use the distribution of the record occurrence under series of independent and identically distributed continuous random variables, to analyze if the observed records are compatible with that behavior. Two families of tests are implemented. The first only requires the record times of the series, while the second includes more powerful tests that join the information from different types of records: upper and lower records in the forward and backward series. The package also offers functions that cover all the steps in this type of analysis such as data preparation, identification of the records, exploratory analysis, and complementary graphical tools. The applicability of the package is illustrated with the analysis of the effect of global warming on the extremes of the daily maximum temperature series in Zaragoza, Spain.","The bayesTFR package for R provides a set of functions to produce probabilistic projections of the total fertility rates for all countries, and is widely used, including as part of the basis for the United Nations official population projections for all countries. Liu and Raftery (2020) extended the theoretical model by adding a layer that accounts for the past total fertility rate estimation uncertainty. A major update of bayesTFR implements the new extension. Moreover, a new feature of producing annual total fertility rate estimation and projections extends the existing functionality of estimating and projecting for five-year time periods. An additional autoregressive component has been developed in order to account for the larger autocorrelation in the annual version of the model. This article summarizes the updated model, describes the basic steps to generate probabilistic estimation and projections under different settings, compares performance, and provides instructions on how to summarize, visualize and diagnose the model results.","In a world with data that change rapidly and abruptly, it is important to detect those changes accurately. In this paper we describe an R package implementing a generalized version of an algorithm recently proposed by Hocking, Rigaill, Fearnhead, and Bourque (2020) for penalized maximum likelihood inference of constrained multiple change-point models. This algorithm can be used to pinpoint the precise locations of abrupt changes in large data sequences. There are many application domains for such models, such as medicine, neuroscience or genomics. Often, practitioners have prior knowledge about the changes they are looking for. For example in genomic data, biologists sometimes expect peaks: up changes followed by down changes. Taking advantage of such prior information can substantially improve the accuracy with which we can detect and estimate changes. Hocking et al. (2020) described a graph framework to encode many examples of such prior information and a generic algorithm to infer the optimal model parameters, but implemented the algorithm for just a single scenario. We present the gfpop package that implements the algorithm in a generic manner in R/C++. gfpop works for a user-defined graph that can encode prior assumptions about the types of changes that are possible and implements several loss functions (Gauss, Poisson, binomial, biweight, and Huber). We then illustrate the use of gfpop on isotonic simulations and several applications in biology. For a number of graphs the algorithm runs in a matter of seconds or minutes for 105 data points.","This article illustrates intRinsic, an R package that implements novel state-of-the-art likelihood-based estimators of the intrinsic dimension of a dataset, an essential quantity for most dimensionality reduction techniques. In order to make these novel estimators easily accessible, the package contains a small number of high-level functions that rely on a broader set of efficient, low-level routines. Generally speaking, intRinsic encompasses models that fall into two categories: homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimension estimators. The first category contains the two nearest neighbors estimator, a method derived from the distributional properties of the ratios of the distances between each data point and its first two closest neighbors. The functions dedicated to this method carry out inference under both the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. In the second category, we find the heterogeneous intrinsic dimension algorithm, a Bayesian mixture model for which an efficient Gibbs sampler is implemented. After presenting the theoretical background, we demonstrate the performance of the models on simulated datasets. This way, we can facilitate the exposition by immediately assessing the validity of the results. Then, we employ the package to study the intrinsic dimension of the Alon dataset, obtained from a famous microarray experiment. Finally, we show how the estimation of homogeneous and heterogeneous intrinsic dimensions allows us to gain valuable insights into the topological structure of a dataset.","Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots are often difficult to interpret because it is unclear how large the deviation from the theoretical distribution must be to indicate a lack of fit. Most Q-Q plots could benefit from the addition of meaningful global testing bands, but the use of such bands unfortunately remains rare because of the drawbacks of current approaches and packages. These drawbacks include incorrect global type-I error rate, lack of power to detect deviations in the tails of the distribution, relatively slow computation for large data sets, and limited applicability. To solve these problems, we apply the equal local levels global testing method, which we have implemented in the R Package qqconf, a versatile tool to create Q-Q plots and probability-probability (P-P) plots in a wide variety of settings, with simultaneous testing bands rapidly created using recently-developed algorithms. qqconf can easily be used to add global testing bands to Q-Q plots made by other packages. In addition to being quick to compute, these bands have a variety of desirable properties, including accurate global levels, equal sensitivity to deviations in all parts of the null distribution (including the tails), and applicability to a range of null distributions. We illustrate the use of qqconf in several applications: assessing normality of residuals from regression, assessing accuracy of p values, and use of Q-Q plots in genome-wide association studies.","Disaggregation modeling, or downscaling, has become an important discipline in epidemiology. Surveillance data, aggregated over large regions, is becoming more common, leading to an increasing demand for modeling frameworks that can deal with this data to understand spatial patterns. Disaggregation regression models use response data aggregated over large heterogeneous regions to make predictions at fine-scale over the region by using fine-scale covariates to inform the heterogeneity. This paper presents the R package disaggregation, which provides functionality to streamline the process of running a disaggregation model for fine-scale predictions.","Unit root tests form an essential part of any time series analysis. We provide practitioners with a single, unified framework for comprehensive and reliable unit root testing in the R package bootUR. The package's backbone is the popular augmented Dickey-Fuller test paired with a union of rejections principle, which can be performed directly on single time series or multiple (including panel) time series. Accurate inference is ensured through the use of bootstrap methods. The package addresses the needs of both novice users, by providing user-friendly and easy-to-implement functions with sensible default options, as well as expert users, by giving full user-control to adjust the tests to one's desired settings. Our parallelized C++ implementation ensures that all unit root tests are scalable to datasets containing many time series."],"publisher":["Foundation for Open Access Statistics","Foundation for Open
